# SDR Oxide Brown — project board content

Three columns. Achieved → **Done**, Open → **In Progress**, Roadmap → **Todo**.
Scripted via `gh project item-create` + `item-edit` once the `project` scope is
granted (`gh auth refresh -h github.com -s project`).

## Achieved (Done)

- **FT8/FT4/FT2 session ignore list** — a `−` per decode row mutes a station for
  the session, at decode ingress
- Release **v1.9.6_brown** (2026-09-29) and the pre-release **v1.9.6_brown.experimental**
- Release **v1.9.5_brown**, **v1.9.4_brown** (Brown rename), nightly builds
- **ALE** receiver core + front end + TX primitive (experimental); upstream draft PR #598
- **JTTY** receive and transmit (experimental, bench-confirmed)
- **Wide CB callsign grammar** (experimental, bench-confirmed)
- **FT8 checkpointed signal subtraction** (weak signals under strong neighbours)
- **digi-mode editable macros** (upstream PR #596, ported to the fork)
- **FSK441** decoder (upstream #555) + transmit (PR #561) and the empty-box/reply fixes
- **Panadapter "levels are hiding the picture" hint** + FIT
- **Auto-record silence split** review fixes (hidden-tab gate, own-stop, Stop-after)
- **Band openings** warm-up/dedupe fix
- **SWL report pre-fills** from the schedule on + NEW
- **Spoken alerts**: phrase preview + SAY
- **Morse trainer**, **CW key** (Settings → CW, USB paddle), **station profiles**
- **Tabbed band/mode menu** (LISTEN/OPERATE, ALL, dock), **SIG ID** guide
- **SWL**: reception log, QSL/report tracking, CSV/ADIF export, filters, schedule,
  local solar time, ECSS, receive tone, replay, scheduled recordings, band scanning
- **Grey line** on the flat maps, **meteor calendar**, **IBP beacons**, **Kp history**
- Decoders landed: **ACARS, HFDL, DSC, UVPacket, NAVTEX, HD Radio, AIS zoom, QO-100**
- **Nine upstream PRs merged** into upstream on 2026-09-28 (#583, #588, #590, #591, #593, …)
- Upstream fixes taken: WEFAX auto start/stop, RADE RX reporting, HD-on-AM, Icom WFM,
  PureSignal gate, TX drive ceiling, LimeSDR Mini, HFDL lane rate

## Open (In Progress)

- **Reported bugs from fork discussion #5 (kevin2008-01), unverified, not yet
  fixed** — separate from the Olivia decode fix (which shipped in 1.9.16):
  - **CLEAR RX appears to do nothing on Olivia.** Wiring looks correct
    (`clear_rx_chip` → `DigiClearRx` → controller `clear_rx` → `text_rx`), and
    1.9.15 produced no Olivia text at all, so this may be a symptom of the
    decoder bug rather than a real button fault. Re-test on 1.9.16; if CLEAR
    still fails with text on screen, it is real (possibly web-session state).
  - **Frequency memories capped at 3 in a new web session** (10 saved → 3
    survive). Store/sync problem in the server session path. Real bug.
  - **A decimal frequency is rounded** (7.038.5 MHz → 7.037). `MemoryChannel
    .freq_hz` is `f64`, so something in the save or display rounds it. Real bug.
- **ALE**: decode a real burst off-air; wire TX; fold the mode into PR #598
- Upstream PRs awaiting review: **#537** band openings, **#545** (tr)uSDX nG,
  **#554** UVPacket, **#557** rec silence, **#559** band-menu captions,
  **#561** FSK441 TX, **#568** Morse trainer, **#569** CW keyer,
  **#572** CW no-link fallback, **#573** CW key package, **#586** FT8 SIC,
  **#598** ALE
- **Rebase #568 and #561** onto current `upstream/main`
- ALE experimental release: publish/finish once the live decode works

## Session ignore list — design (coded, 2026-09-29)

**Why session-only:** a memory `HashSet` with no file, no wire, no schema is
cheaper to run and to build than a persisted list, and avoids permanent hiding.
Familiar `−` UX without the permanence. Keep the filter as
`session_ignored ∪ (future persisted)` so persistence can be added later.

**As built (fork-only, UI layer):**
- `SdroxideApp` gains `session_ignored: ignore::Ignored` (a `HashSet<String>`,
  init in `app/mod.rs` alongside `digi_status`). No `PROTO_VERSION` change.
- `app/ignore.rs` holds the whole rule: `key` (trim + upper), `is_ignored`,
  `toggle`, `retain_unignored`, and `toggle_ignore` / `clear_ignored` /
  `ignored_hover`. Six unit tests.
- Decode row: a `−` chip beside the queue `+`/`＋` chip (`panels/decodes.rs`),
  drawn for any decode naming a sender, so it works for listeners too. The
  press is staged and written after the row loop (which holds borrows).
- **Filter at ingress**, in the `RadioEvent::Ft8Decodes` arm in `frame.rs` —
  before the announcer, the audible alerts, the decode list and the propagation
  field, so one rule covers all of them. Empty batch → `continue`.
- **Mute everything** also asked in `auto_target`, because rows held *before*
  the press are still in `digi_decodes`; without it auto mode would answer the
  very station just muted. Spotting/upload untouched.
- **Undo/visibility**: an `N ignored · clear` chip in the decode header, drawn
  only when non-empty. Muted rows are dimmed (`ROW_BG × 0.45`, grey accent,
  badge `MUTED`) and age out, so a mis-click is reversible and nothing refills
  the space.
- Glyphs are `−` / `×` — both already load-bearing in `sdroxide-ui`; a
  pictographic "no entry" sign was the one glyph at risk of the font atlas not
  carrying it.


## Roadmap (Todo)

- **Performance pass** — a full optimize run over the per-frame paths, not
  started. Nothing measured is *known* to be slow; the point is to find out
  where the time actually goes rather than to guess. Where to look, and what is
  already ruled out, so the next session does not re-derive it:
  - **The decode-list row loop** (`app/panels/decodes.rs`, 200 rows/frame) is the
    prime suspect: per row it clones the sender for `who`, builds several
    `RichText`s, and runs two layout passes. This is the heaviest per-frame
    allocation site in the UI.
  - **The session ignore list is NOT a problem** — measured 2026-09-29 in
    release: `is_ignored` over all 200 rows costs **7.6 µs/frame (37 ns/call)**,
    0.05 % of a 60 fps frame, and 3.4 µs of that is the `to_ascii_uppercase`
    `String` the row already pays for `who`. **Do not "optimize" it**; a
    `HashSet<String>` was chosen over `&str`/`Cow` deliberately — the set is
    session-sized and the clarity is worth the allocation.
  - Other suspects, unmeasured: `log_index()` (rebuilds when the log length
    changes — check it is not rebuilding per frame), `auto_target`'s `live` Vec
    clone (only when the ignore set is non-empty), the waterfall/spectrum
    repaint, and the prop/map texture rebuilds.
  - Method: `cargo test --release` with a `#[test]` + `Instant` harness
    (`std::time::Instant`, no criterion in the tree) run under
    `--release` — a debug-build measurement of a path this hot is meaningless.
    Beware the repo's `rustfmt.toml`: a bench harness left in a source file
    must be removed or it will not compile.
- **DAB/DAB+** — blocked on `xoolive/desperado#52` (library split)
- **M17** (RX-first) and **ALE Selcall**
- **DSC** audio front end (protocol+framer done; detector needs a real burst)
- **Inmarsat** (wideband-lane decoder, upstream #187)
- Decoder candidates: **POCSAG/FLEX**, **ARDOP**, **FLARM/OGN**, **UAT 978**
- Listener: **D-RAP absorption map**, **azimuthal map**, solar-wind/Bz sparklines,
  solar-cycle chart, broadcast noise reduction
- **Phase 4 polish**: say why the dial is not the frequency you picked; UTC everywhere
- **CW reception reporting** to PSK Reporter
