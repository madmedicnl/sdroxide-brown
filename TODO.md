# TODO — SDR Oxide Brown

Working queue. Rules in AGENTS.md. Last updated 2026-11-01.

State: `main` at crate 2.2.0, PROTO_VERSION 260 (0x50). Latest release
v2.2.3.5_brown (pre-release). Open PRs: 6 (#385 F4NRM's PROGRAMS, #389 revert
of #371, #390 #357, #391 the two red tests, #392 #354, #393 #239). Open issues: 16
(re-measured 2026-11-01).

## Task tracking rules

- Every task started: add to **Now** (one line: what, why, where from) and board
  **In Progress** before starting.
- Every task finished: move to **Recently done** (today's date, one line) and
  board **Achieved**; remove from In Progress.
- Every task blocked: move to **Waiting on other people** with the single question.
- Issues take priority over development.
- Each task must name who added it and who owns it:
  `Item (added by X, owned by Y) — description.`
- Re-measurable numbers (crate version, PROTO_VERSION, open issues/PRs) must be
  kept current in the state line.

## Now

- Translation rules in AGENTS.md and the "new language" sync rule in CLAUDE.md (added by F4NRM, owned by Claude) — branch `f4nrm/compassionate-mendel-e3kjll`, PR pending: the maintainer's agent is driven by AGENTS.md, which lacked the translation rule, and shipped English-only messages (#395); AGENTS.md now carries the eleven-language rule, and CLAUDE.md says a new language must update the list in both files. Docs only. Wacht op F4NRM's review.
- Airport card: one airport = one card (added by F4NRM, owned by Claude) — branch `f4nrm/youthful-mayer-38fi1q`, PR pending: radio aids within 3 km of a field (EPL beside LFSG) are listed on the airport's card and no longer have a symbol that steals the click; the card shows height, distances, runway lengths and temperature in both systems; "no frequency published" is said instead of silence.
- Airport card: Wikipedia picture stays on "…" (added by F4NRM, owned by Claude) — same branch and PR: repaint when the picture arrives (the poll runs after the map is drawn), a 404 from the station settles at once instead of three retries.
- Airport card: 91 airports never got a picture (added by F4NRM, owned by Claude) — same branch and PR: `Article::new` refused titles with an en dash or a quote (KATL, CYUL, EDAC…); test over every title of `wiki.bin`.
- Pinned ADS-B card: lookup follows the question, thumbnail comes back, retry countdown (reported by F4NRM, owned by Claude) — branch `f4nrm/bold-ramanujan-ckwlff`, PR #394: a click on empty map now closes the pinned card (no ✕ needed for beginners); after a closed card the picture was never asked again (`thumb_wish` depended on the pressed lookup), and a failed or lost question was never retried on the map card (only the Cards view asks every frame), so the card stayed on radio data. Now the pressed lookup is followed every frame, a failure shows "trying again in N s" with the button back, and the picture is wanted whenever the answer has one.
- PROGRAMS list overflow in long languages and wide windows (added by F4NRM, owned by Claude) — branch `f4nrm/kind-maxwell-8m2ipv`, same family as MEMORIES #373: columns built for the width left after the scroll bar, window floor follows the language, `schedule_preview` test renders the real window. Update: gap after the name capped at 40 characters, right-hand group against the edge. Update 2: PROGRAMS state (TOUT, stars, filters, colours) moves to the station — `/programs-state` route + client sync, nothing kept in the browser. Built and tested: server (7 tests), ui (22), types, wasm32 check; the sandbox needs `OPUS_URL` set to a local zip of opus 940d4e5 (git fetch + `git archive`) because the archive download is refused. Wacht op F4NRM's review.
- PROGRAMS window layout and persistence (added by F4NRM, owned by Claude) — branch `f4nrm/stoic-fermi-a0z0zp`, PR pending: columns, Sort menus, chip-framed colour, two-row bar, saved filters. Wacht op F4NRM's review.
- SAT Doppler for CAT rigs (added by Roy, owned by Roy/SP9TKN) — step 1+2a+2b+2c
  implemented on branch `fork/sat-doppler-cat`. MSI build available. Wacht op
  SP9TKN's testresultaten. Design doc: `docs/SAT-DOPPLER-CAT-PLAN.md`.
- NAVTEX restore (added by Roy, owned by Roy) — PR #317 open, mergeable. Wacht
  op F4NRM's test.
- ADS-B overlay (added by Roy, owned by Roy) — PR #312 open. Wacht op F4NRM's
  review (relay rule gefixt).
- Airspy HF+ per-rate usable span (added by Roy, owned by Roy) — PR #309 open.
  Wacht op Graeme's test.
- Antenna calculator (added by Roy, owned by Roy) — PR #304 open.
- FT8 auto queue UI (added by Roy, owned by Roy) — PR #323 open (not
  live-tested).
- NAVTEX sync-drop (added by Roy, owned by Roy) — PR #308 open.
- UDP feed VDL2/ACARS/DSC/HFDL (added by Roy, owned by Roy) — PR #318 open.
  Rolling-window fix toegepast.
- APRS panel: all messages heard, 500 kept, composer note, RX/TX engine tests (added by madmedicnl, owned by Roy; touches F4NRM's APRS area, PR for his review) — decoder fault #259 not reproduced in the engine; needs a real capture.
- Per-band TX permission (added by madmedicnl, owned by Roy; touches the radio engine and every radio tab, PR for F4NRM's review) — PR #358 open, not merged. Every band has a YES/NO switch in Settings; new install = all off, upgrade = bands carried over but TX blocked until the operator confirms once per radio; not applied on SWL/listen screens. PROTO_VERSION 259 (0x4F). Needs a hands-on test with a real radio.
- TX band banner is a warning, not a lock (added by madmedicnl, owned by Claude; touches every radio tab, PR for F4NRM's review) — PR A: the dial is never held or put back, no forced listen mode, no "Listen mode" button, "Close" only; one message in the interface language (5 languages); at most 3 showings per session and per radio tab, count not saved. Fixes the false banner on 80 m at 3.643 MHz (stale radio config) and the Radio classic waterfall click that snapped back.
- BAND TX pill + "11M-CB" label (added by madmedicnl, owned by Claude; PR B, re-pushed on main after #377 merged into the PR A branch) — pill under "BW cascade": green = allowed, red = refused, blinking red = transmitting; hidden on SWL, listen mode, receive-only radios and when no band is ticked and confirmed. "11M" shown as "11M-CB" in the TX band plan only.
- APRS panel fit and heard text (added by madmedicnl, owned by Claude; touches F4NRM's APRS area) — branch `f4nrm/amazing-einstein-sqkc6q`, PR pending: the message pane is sized from what is really left (map chip row and gaps counted) so the composer no longer hangs off the window bottom; ALL also lists station comments/status heard. Not live-tested on screen.
- MEMORIES panel fit (added by F4NRM, owned by Claude) — branch `f4nrm/memories-panel-fit`, PR pending: name rows sized to their button, chip-framed colour, PST at chip height. Wacht op F4NRM's review.
- FT8 setup window drew its captions with no controls beside them (#357) (added by F4NRM, owned by Roy; FT8 is his area, PR for his review) — `setup-tx-audio` carried a hint paragraph as well as the caption, the dialog draws it as a row label of a two-column grid, so the label column measured 1356 pt and every control beside it was pushed off the window. Removed from all 11 languages, render probe + caption test added. PR #390.
- Settings reports the crate version, not the installed release (#354) (added by F4NRM, owned by Roy) — a release now reports the tag's own version (`SDROXIDE_RELEASE` from `GITHUB_REF_NAME`), and the window title follows it. PR #392.
- The two tests our last three merges left red on main (i18n orphans from #372/#368/#355, and the WEFAX header test still asking for the removed `Auto` chip) (added by Roy, owned by Roy; WEFAX is F4NRM's area, PR for his review) — PR #391.
- WEFAX auto-slant believes a bad measurement (#239) (added by F4NRM, owned by Roy; WEFAX is his area, PR for his review) — a noisy phasing pulse read as a 47 500 ppm clock error, the line was cut 4.75 % short, and charts came out as bands. Guarded to 2000 ppm with the baseline re-taken; test fails on the old code. PR #393. Next: a full-chart decode in the WEFAX tests, which is the gap this fell through.

## Backlog — our open issues (board: Todo)

- #388 HL2 (HPSDR P1) datagram loss every ~2 s (added by DK8JV, owned by Roy).
- #340 S-meter (added by F4NRM, owned by Roy) — measurement disagrees with the report; the measurement is the first suspect.

## Recently done
- 2026-11-01 — PR #74 (S-Meter calib) re-checked against `main` (added by F4NRM, owned by Claude): the feature is intact (`smeter_cal` ±5 S, applied once in `frame.rs`, row under "Antenna is", 11 languages, manual §2.9); the two UI tests, the `sdroxide-types` test and the i18n tests pass. Only tidied the Settings row (stray blank line, `rustfmt` shape) and gave the feature one accurate CHANGELOG line.
- 2026-11-01 — TX lock on listening/broadcast frequencies: PTT and TUNE (desktop strip and classic layout, which had no guard) are greyed with a big red message on hover and on every press (mouse, key, MIDI; uncapped); one rule — transmit only on bands ticked AND validated in Settings → Radio, refused everywhere else (SWL/broadcast/Other included, no more separate amateur-only rail while the list is in force); "Allow transmit on 11 m (CB)" and the 11M-CB tick are one setting in both directions; unknown capabilities grey the PTT. Not yet built or tested here: the sandbox cannot download Opus for `sdroxide-rade` (403), so the UI crate was only syntax-checked; `sdroxide-types` tests pass. The engine's band refusal is typed (`RadioEvent::TxRefused` / `ServerMsg::TxRefused`, PROTO_VERSION 259 → 260) and worded in the operator's language by the UI; other engine refusals stay English. Branch `f4nrm/relaxed-wozniak-b4m3da` (added by madmedicnl, owned by Claude; PR only with F4NRM's OK)
- 2026-11-01 — CTR on FT8/FT4/JS8/WSPR/Pi4/PSK centres the middle of the decode band (dial + 1500 Hz) instead of the dial, so the whole 0–3 kHz spectrum is in the window and the station boxes sit on their signals; `ctr_zoom_sim` gesture test added (added by F4NRM, owned by Claude; PR for his review)
- 2026-10-31 — Airport card (PR 2 of 4): the pinned card lists up to 4 runways and 6 frequencies from embedded OurAirports tables (offline, dated), lengths in the chosen units, and "aircraft within" reaches 100 km instead of 25 (added by madmedicnl, owned by Roy)
- 2026-10-31 — Aircraft online relay is ON by default and one visible "Online" switch sits at the top of the AIRCRAFT window (was off, hidden under a selected card, 4 clicks away). The station keeps an "off" mark (`aircraft-online.off`); `SDROXIDE_AIRCRAFT_ONLINE=0` holds it off, `=1` on. First of 4 PRs for the airport card (runways/frequencies, Wikipedia thumbnail, local time/temperature follow) (added by madmedicnl, owned by Roy; changes a privacy default, PR for F4NRM's review)
- 2026-10-30 — Aircraft photo: the station keeps 10 thumbnails for 30 s (was 1), loads several aircraft at once (up to 3, same aircraft once) instead of answering 429, frees its place even if a download panics, a closing card releases only its own picture, and a failed thumbnail is asked again (3 times) while the card stays open (added by madmedicnl, owned by Roy)
- 2026-10-29 — Every message log keeps at most 200 (ACARS, DSC, APRS, VDL2 were 300/300/300/2000), VDL2 list newest first (added by madmedicnl, owned by Roy; touches F4NRM's DSC/NAVTEX/APRS caps, PR for his review)
- 2026-10-29 — ACARS channel chips tune the VFO in use, light the real channel, grey out unreachable ones (added by madmedicnl, owned by Roy)
- 2026-10-29 — Aircraft online read: a failing or slow card no longer blocks the others (3 at once, 15 s limit, retry 30 s, failure says so) (added by madmedicnl, owned by Roy)
- 2026-10-29 — Aircraft photo a quarter larger: map card 84→106 px, Cards view 140→175 px (added by madmedicnl, owned by Roy)
- 2026-10-29 — Language selector in Settings → UI with Apply button (PR #339, #331)
- 2026-10-29 — S-meter calibration removed from UI and reading (PR #341, #340)
- 2026-10-29 — SSTV received-image viewer nav + composer text transfer (PR #333)

- 2026-10-29 — FT8 auto queue UI
- 2026-10-29 — Grey-line gradient confirmed
- 2026-10-29 — S-meter troubleshooting (wireless mouse RFI) added to manual
- 2026-10-29 — STANAG 4285 finished (coded payload not implemented — legal)
- 2026-10-29 — Olivia proven (RX+TX)
- 2026-10-29 — S-meter still an issue
- 2026-10-31 — Airport card (PR 4 of 4): the pinned card shows the airport's local time and temperature, online only — the station asks Open-Meteo (`/airport-weather?lat=&lon=`, only the airport's position rounded to ~1 km, kept 30 s in memory, same sign-in/switch/ceiling as the other online routes, credit shown); local time is the client's UTC clock moved by the zone's offset (summer time included), 12 h/°F in Imperial and 24 h/°C otherwise; offline it reads "UTC hh:mm (local time: offline)", never an invented local time (added by madmedicnl, owned by Roy)
- 2026-10-28 — NAVTEX false-sync fix
- 2026-10-28 — WEFAX negative auto-correct
- 2026-10-28 — #265 "outside receive range" notice fixed (logged, not shown)
- 2026-10-27 — Aircraft window clean-up (10 PRs)
- 2026-10-27 — #283 settings question resolved (da78715b)
- 2026-10-31 — Airport card (PR 3 of 4): the pinned card shows the airport's Wikipedia thumbnail, asked of the station (`/airport-photo?lang=&title=`, hosts fixed to `*.wikipedia.org` and `upload.wikimedia.org`), held in memory for the open card only and dropped when it closes, credit links to the article; `PhotoStore` is now generic on its key (added by madmedicnl, owned by Roy)
