# Undocked mode — START HERE (the next project)

**This is the fresh-session starting point (2026-10-09).** Read it top to bottom.
`main` is green, everything in the queue is merged, and the next piece of work
is the one below.

A new layout where chosen modules live in their **own OS windows** — like GIMP's
and SDRuno's detachable panels — so the main window can give its space to the
controls and decoders while the waterfall sits on a second monitor. Today every
`LayoutMode` (Desktop / Tablet / Small / Phone / Auto) stacks every module into
the **one** window; operators have asked repeatedly for the waterfall detached,
and the fork already has the mechanism (the solar3d viewport).

## TODO (do these in order)

- [x] **1. State.** `DetachedWindow` + `UiSettings::{panadapter_detached,
      panadapter_window}` — landed (`21c204fa`). No wire bump (local config).
- [x] **2. Extract `draw_panadapter`.** Both panadapter blocks — the digital
      path and the CW/analog path — lifted into one inherent
      `SdroxideApp::draw_panadapter`; the main-window draw is byte-identical
      (`747bfb82`). `cw_panadapter` and the render tests stayed green.
- [x] **3. The toggle, named "Undocked".** A **Settings → UI → Panadapter
      window** picker — *Docked in this window* / *Undocked — its own window* —
      with the Wayland caveat in its hover. Deliberately a settings choice
      rather than a strip chip: it is a workspace arrangement kept for good, not
      a mid-QSO control. Works in **every mode** (a voice mode leaves the main
      window's column to whatever the mode has; a digital mode leaves its
      operating panel). `close_requested` docks it again.
- [x] **4. The detached window.** `show_viewport_immediate` (native only) with
      app-id `sdroxide-panadapter` and a stable title. Immediate, not deferred:
      the draw borrows `&mut self`. One window for the **station**, owned by
      the focused radio (`UiSettings` is station-wide, so a per-radio id would
      remap the window on every switch).
- [x] **5. The main window reclaims the space.** `panadapter_split` returns a
      zero waterfall height when detached; pure test on the arithmetic plus the
      both-edges render test run detached too.
- [x] **6. Persist geometry** on the rebuild frame, and once a drag settles
      (not a write a frame).
- [x] **7. The overlay.** A big, display-only dial readout over the detached
      panadapter; the tuning strip and S-meter stay in the main window.
- [x] **8. Gate + install.** Workspace check silent, wasm check unchanged (273
      warnings), `sdroxide-ui` lib 757 passed, `cw_panadapter` green. Built and
      installed as `2.0.2_brown`; a live run on niri opened the window with
      app-id `sdroxide-panadapter` and persisted its geometry.

**Status (2026-10-09): the first slice, the second module, the shared helper
and the shell-owned window manager are built, committed and installed.** The
control lives in **Settings → UI** (one row per module, named **Undocked**), and
works in every mode.

**The module registry and the shared helper exist** (the step the handover called
"generalise to any detachable module"):
- `sdroxide_types::DetachableModule` (`Panadapter`, `Panel`) with
  `DetachedState { detached, window }`, held as an **array** in
  `UiSettings::detached` indexed by `module.index()` — an array and not a map
  so `UiSettings` stays `Copy`, which the whole UI leans on. A new module is a
  variant plus a UI spec. The pre-array `panadapter_detached` /
  `panadapter_window` keys migrate at load (`UiSettings::migrate_detached`).
- `frame.rs`: `DetachedWindowSpec` + `detached_spec(module)` (ids, app-id,
  title, size), one free `detached_viewport(ctx, spec, seed, draw)` that owns
  the whole multi-window plumbing, `panadapter_inputs()` so the panadapter draw
  is self-contained, `column_split(...)` for the arithmetic, and
  `dispatch_commands()` so a window's clicks are applied like the main
  window's.
- **Panel `app-id`: `sdroxide-panel`.** Panadapter: `sdroxide-panadapter`.

**The shell owns the windows now** (the handover's "shell-owned window manager"):
each frame `MultiApp` asks the focused radio's app which windows it wants
(`SdroxideApp::detached_wanted`) and emits those, once, whatever pane or tab is
on screen — so a radio or mode change can no longer tear a window down and have
a tiling compositor re-place it. `show_detached_module` is the app's half (how
to draw itself); the shell's is *whether the window exists*.

**The vacated centre is filled, and a mode with no panel opens no window**
(commit `24b6a3ce`, from the operator's screenshots). When both modules are
undocked the main window centre was a black hole; now `center_has_content()`
detects it and `band_menu_fill()` draws the band/mode selector there (the dock's
body is shared as `band_menu_body`). And a voice mode no longer opens a
placeholder panel window — `panel_window_wanted` requires a panel, and a
one-per-mode dismissible notice names the mode instead ("No operating panel in
AM …").

**The app-id and the window rules are documented** (`7c3b9ad5`): `app_id()` is a
method on `DetachableModule` (one source, used by the window spec and the
Settings hover), and the manual has an **Undocked** section under Settings → UI
with the app-id table and a **niri `window-rule`** example to float and pin the
windows to monitors (the app cannot place a window on Wayland; that is the one
thing the operator does, and it is documented rather than assumed).

**The panadapter window is self-sufficient** (`f7e4674a`): the big frequency
readout now has the **mode and signal level** under it (read-only, sharing the
main window's meter), so the second monitor needs no glance at the first. And a
**Dock all windows** chip in Settings → UI brings every window back at once.

**The destination, so the next slice aims at it:** a user-arrangeable workspace
in the SDRuno mould — each module (the panadapter, the control surface, the
decoders, the scanner) in its own window, placed by the operator. Adding a docked
module is now: a `DetachableModule` variant, its `detached_spec`, a
`show_detached_module` arm, and (if it is not always present) a
`*_window_wanted` predicate — the registry, the shell and the Settings rows take
care of the rest. The **next module** is the real design question: the **control
surface** (SDRuno's "RX control") is the pair to the panadapter but lives in the
top strip, whose rows are measured and packed, so it is the risky one; a
**decoder window** (the decode list) is cleaner but its list is drawn from
several mode panels; the **scanner** and the other tool windows are a different
mechanism (egui windows, not docked panels) and would need extracting their
bodies. Nothing else is owed.

Everything below is the reference for those steps.

## What already exists (the groundwork — this is why it is not from scratch)

- **Multi-viewport is proven on this codebase.** The solar-system view is a real
  separate OS window, built with `ctx.show_viewport_deferred(vid, builder, …)`
  and an `egui::ViewportBuilder` — `crates/sdroxide-ui/src/solar3d/mod.rs`
  (`viewport_id`, around `:346`–`:366`). Any widget can be rendered into such a
  viewport; that is the whole of the "own window" mechanism.
- **Geometry persistence has a pattern.** `UiSettings::solar3d_window:
  Option<Solar3dWindow>` (`crates/sdroxide-types/src/ui.rs`) carries size and
  position, seeded into the builder only on the **rebuild frame**
  (`cumulative_pass_nr_for(vid) == 0`) so a live resize is never fought.
- **Per-radio window identity exists.** `layout::radio_salt(ctx)`
  (`crates/sdroxide-ui/src/layout.rs:275`) salts the viewport id per radio;
  `solar3d::viewport_id(salt)` builds it.
- **The one-window/one-owner rule exists.** The 3D window's `keep_alive` and
  owner cap (`solar3d/mod.rs:417`, and the AGENTS note "The 3D window in the
  multi-radio shell") are exactly the problem a detached panadapter has: a
  second window owned by a per-radio app, in a shell that draws only the visible
  tab. Read that note before touching any of it.
- **The layout enum is where a mode slots in.** `LayoutMode`
  (`sdroxide-types/src/ui.rs:244`) is `Desktop / Tablet / Phone / Small / Auto`;
  `layout::tier_for` (`:80`) maps it and the viewport size to a `Tier`. A new
  mode is appended **before `Auto`**, which must stay last because it carries
  `#[serde(other)]`.

## The known caveat, stated up front: Wayland, and **Niri**

A Wayland client **cannot set its own window position**. `viewport().inner_rect`
and `outer_rect` are `None` there (the solar3d notes record this) — only the
size comes back. So on Wayland "put it on monitor 2" is **best-effort**: size is
exact, placement is the compositor's. X11, Windows and macOS return real
geometry and honour a position. Say this in the UI copy rather than pretending.

**Niri is the operator's WM, and it is already a named target** in the "3D
window in the multi-radio shell" note (a remapped window is a *new* window to a
tiling compositor like niri/sway, so `keep_alive` is what holds its place).
Undocked mode meets Niri the same way, and the path is clearer than it looks:

- A detached viewport is a **new toplevel**, and Niri **tiles** it like anything
  else. To make it **float** — the operator's wish — is a Niri **window rule**,
  not an app call:
  ```kdl
  window-rule {
      match app-id="sdroxide-panadapter"
      open-floating true
      // and put it where the operator wants it:
      // open-on-output "HDMI-A-1"
      default-column-width { fixed 1200; }
      default-window-height { fixed 720; }
  }
  ```
- That is why the detached window must set **`with_app_id`** (and a title): it
  is the only handle a compositor rule has. Niri can also match on **title**, so
  even the 3D window (title only) is routable today — but a stable app-id is the
  better key.
- **`with_position` is ignored on Wayland/Niri.** Placement is `open-on-output`
  / `open-on-workspace` in the operator's rule, which is *better* for the
  "second monitor" case than anything the app could do.
- **`with_window_level`** (always-on-top) is compositor-dependent; do not rely
  on it. Niri floats and layers via its rules.
- **Emit the window every frame.** Niri destroys a window that stops being
  emitted and recompositor-places it on return — the `keep_alive` lesson, and
  the reason a detached panadapter (like solar3d) must stay alive while its tab
  is hidden.

Net: the app's job is to **expose the identity and the size**; *floating and
placing it on a chosen monitor is the operator's one-line rule*. That is the
honest division, and what the manual should say.

## Scope

**In (the first slice, below):** a detach toggle, the **panadapter** as one
detached window, its geometry persisted, and the main window reclaiming the
space.

**Out (later):** a general docking framework (any module, arbitrary splits and
tabbing); guaranteed multi-monitor placement under Wayland; floating in tiling
WMs; carrying the detached geometry on the wire (decide when it matters).

## First slice — the detached PANADAPTER

The single most-requested case, and the one that proves the pattern. Do not
build a framework first.

1. **State.** ✅ **Done (2026-10-08).** `DetachedWindow { size: [f32; 2], pos:
   Option<[f32; 2]> }` and `UiSettings::{panadapter_detached, panadapter_window}`
   are in `crates/sdroxide-types/src/ui.rs`, appended last, mirroring
   `Solar3dWindow`. **No `PROTO_VERSION` bump**: `UiSettings` is local
   `config.toml` and is *never* on the wire (it is `ClientScreen` that is — see
   its own doc). A bump would only be owed if the flag were carried in
   `ClientScreen` instead, which is the "does the detached geometry travel?"
   decision left to later. Machine-local is the default and what landed.
2. **The toggle.** A `DETACH` action in the panadapter's DISP row, with hover
   text saying where the window goes and the Wayland caveat. Turning it off (or
   closing the window — handle `ViewportEvent::Close`) re-attaches.
3. **The main window reclaims the space.** The digital split already computes
   `(waterfall_h, panel_h)` summing to the area (`frame.rs`, the `digi_split` /
   panadapter region). Detached ⇒ `waterfall_h = 0` and the operating panel
   takes the whole column. This is the part worth a **pure test**.
4. **The detached window — use `show_viewport_immediate`, not `_deferred`.**
   `spectrum_view::show_ext` borrows `&mut self`'s fields (view, state, peaks,
   smooth, trace cache, spec3d), and solar3d's `show_viewport_deferred` wants an
   `Fn + Send + Sync + 'static` closure — which **cannot** borrow `self`, so it
   would force the panadapter onto a published snapshot. Instead
   `Context::show_viewport_immediate(id, builder, impl FnMut(&mut Ui,
   ViewportClass))` (egui 0.36, `context.rs:4116`) is called in the **same
   frame** and may borrow `self`, so the existing draw moves over nearly
   unchanged. Build it with `ViewportBuilder::default().with_app_id(
   "sdroxide-panadapter").with_title(…)`, and `with_inner_size` /
   `with_position` from the persisted geometry. **The `with_app_id` is not
   decoration**: it is what a Wayland window rule matches on to float and place
   the window (see "Niri" below). solar3d sets only a title today; a detached
   window should carry its own id.
5. **Persist geometry.** Capture `inner_rect` / `outer_rect` on the rebuild
   frame only (the solar3d pattern), so a drag is not undone each frame.
6. **Native only.** `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]` throughout the detach
   path; the browser keeps the panadapter in-window.

**What the detached window contains (decided 2026-10-08).** Spectrum + waterfall
+ a **big centred frequency** readout over it (the `centred_waterfall_note`
pattern), and optionally a compact S-level. The **tuning strip and the real
S-meter stay in the main window** — one owner for controls, so a value can never
disagree with itself across two windows, and the panadapter stays a *view*
(click/drag tuning on it still works, it is the same widget).

### Step 2 in practice — the extraction

`frame.rs`'s panadapter block is a deeply nested closure (`ui.allocate_ui(
vec2(width, wf_h), |ui| { … spectrum_view::show_ext(…) })`, roughly
`frame.rs:765`–`:904`) capturing many locals (`mode`, `live`, `wf_tuning`,
`atsmini`, `audio_hz`, `markers`, `ft8_spots`, `ft8_alpha`, `net_spots`,
`net_alpha`, `clicked_spot`, `ism_labels`, `mem_marks`, `pan`, `show_panel`,
`cmds`, `now`, `frame`) plus `self` fields. The work is to lift its body into
`fn draw_panadapter(&mut self, ui, <those by-ref>)`, then call it from:

- the main window, when **not** detached (`if show_wf && !detached`);
- the immediate viewport, when detached — `ctx.show_viewport_immediate(vid,
  builder, |ui, _| ui.allocate_ui(viewport_size, |ui|
  self.draw_panadapter(…)))`.

**Do that extraction as its own commit and land the main-window draw
byte-identical first**, so a mistake in the move is visible before any of the
viewport is wired. Only then add the toggle, the geometry persistence and
`ViewportEvent::Close`.

**The oracle.** The detached window itself cannot be asserted headlessly, so the
test is the **main-window layout**: with the panadapter detached, the operating
panel takes the full height and still stays inside its column — the same
both-edges check as `the_operating_panel_stays_inside_its_column`
(`crates/sdroxide-ui/src/app/mod.rs`). Plus a pure unit test of the split
arithmetic (`waterfall_h == 0`).

## Workflow and house rules (do not skip)

- **Gate before any tag:** `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` **silent**,
  then `cargo test --release --workspace`.
- **The wasm check is mandatory** whenever a wasm-reachable file changes:
  `cargo check --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p sdroxide-ui`. The
  detach must not pull a native-only path into the browser build — the DAB
  radio-tab move (`5bef39e7`) broke exactly this and the check caught it.
- **Wire:** only **`ClientScreen`** rides the wire, whole — `UiSettings` does
  **not** (it is local `config.toml`; putting it on the wire is the trap its own
  doc warns about). So a field added to `UiSettings` needs no bump; a
  `ClientScreen` field or a new `LayoutMode` variant does — a `PROTO_VERSION`
  bump plus a register line in `crates/sdroxide-proto/src/lib.rs`. `LayoutMode`
  is appended **before `Auto`**.
- **A new `LayoutMode` variant** is also a `ClientScreen` change and is
  validated by the "catch-all last" rule — read `Auto`'s own doc first.
- **Multi-radio is the risk area.** Reuse the owner-cap/`keep_alive` model from
  solar3d; do not leave N radios each emitting a window.

## Later, when the slice works

- **Generalise to any detachable module** (decoders, band/mode dock) on the same
  `DetachedWindow` type, rather than a boolean per module.
- **The shell-owned window manager.** The AGENTS note already names the real
  fix: "a shell-owned window manager with stable viewport ids and an explicit
  owner, emitted every frame regardless of focus". A general undocked mode is
  the natural home for it.
- **Floating in tiling WMs** (the operator runs **Niri**): a tiling compositor
  tiles a new toplevel; making it float, and pinning it to a monitor, is a
  **Niri `window-rule`** the operator sets (see the Niri section above) — not
  something a Wayland client can assert. The app's contribution is the
  **app-id** the rule matches on. Worth a short manual section; not an app
  feature.
- **Whether the detached geometry travels** on `ClientScreen` (a remote client
  that wants its own arrangement) — a decision, not a default.

## Bench checks before committing to it

1. **Does a second viewport render the wgpu waterfall cleanly, and at what
   cost?** The panadapter is the GPU-heavy widget; the 3D window is the only
   precedent and it is a different render path.
2. **Multi-radio:** who owns the detached panadapter, and what a tab switch
   does (the solar3d owner-cap problem, exactly).
3. **Wayland:** confirm on niri/sway that a detached window can at least be
   resized and moved by the operator, and that the app reads a sane size back.
