# ROADMAP — SDR Oxide, the CB and SWL fork

What this fork is for: turning sdroxide's receiver into the best **shortwave
listening** and **11 m** program it can be — no licence, no callsign, no
transmitting unless asked for. This file is the plan for the listener side; it
changes as the fork teaches us what matters, and it is the part that stays
here. General-purpose work goes upstream (see "Relationship to upstream").

Ordered by value to a listener, not by effort. Each phase is meant to stand on
its own.

## Toward 2.5 — the plan as of 2026-10-07

The first four phases are done and are history; this is what the fork is for
next, and it is a much shorter list than the phases above. It comes out of a
week in which almost nothing was invented and almost everything came from one
tester's reports, which is the right way round and worth saying out loud.

**The three things being built this month:**

1. **The ATS Mini as a second control surface** — the cheap, popular Si4732
   board. We already speak the stock firmware (`Backend::AtsMini`); this adds the
   scripting firmware's **documented serial command set**, so a board whose
   owner prefers that firmware can be tuned from sdroxide as well. It is small,
   fork-only, needs no protocol change, and — the reason it is first — it can be
   **proven on our own bench before it is released.** The radio is not an SDR:
   it hands over demodulated audio and there is no I/Q, so every wideband feature
   stays out of reach on it, and that is a property of the silicon rather than a
   gap in the work.
2. **DAB's MOT slideshow and DLS** — the station images and the station text the
   ensemble already broadcasts. Everything needed is in place; it wants its own
   message pair rather than a field, because a snapshot goes out several times a
   second and an image does not. Not yet verifiable: it needs a capture of an
   ensemble whose service actually broadcasts one.
3. **DMR** — asked for, honestly unscoped. It is a VHF/UHF mode, so it needs a
   front end that reaches there, and the hard part is the AMBE+2 voice codec. It
   fits the wideband-lane machinery we already have for ADS-B, AIS and DAB.

**Also on the list, in no particular order:** **FST4W**, the last of the WSJT
suite we lack (the mode inventory against WSJT-X is in `FST4W-HANDOVER.md`).

**Deliberately off the list, and why — recorded so it is not re-litigated:**

- **The three-radio tab-close flicker.** Undiagnosed, and it needs one answer
  from the reporter that we do not have. It will be caught by our own bench
  testing with three radios attached, which is where a bug that only appears at
  three tabs belongs in the first place.
- **The 2 pt page overflow** (the missing right border). Cosmetic, reproduced by
  an oracle that is already in the tree, and it will be chased during the bench
  testing weeks when there is a screen to look at rather than a number.
- **The empty station-key guard.** A real fault, masked by the sign-in cookie,
  and harmless while it stays masked. To be picked up when there is time — with
  the sign that something actually depends on it, not before.
- **"Some phones crash, others do not."** Dropped. If it is a phone and not the
  page, no amount of work here will find it, and the only honest route is a
  desktop browser reproduction.
- **DAB audio at 2.5 Msps.** Working, and the program says why: it warns that the
  front end is at its floor and to widen the window to 3.1 Msps or more. A
  warning that names the fix is the feature.
- **Olivia transmit interop.** Nobody outside can decode our Olivia yet, and no
  amount of reading our own code will prove it. It needs somebody with an
  fldigi on the other end. If that is you, it is the single most useful
  observation anyone could send us.
- **The Pluto / ADS-B 100 % CPU.** Real, predates every version, and outside what
  our bench can reproduce — we have no Pluto. Open to anybody who has one.

**And the one that is not a feature at all:** we still cannot drive a browser
here. One real bug got through that way — a sign-in prompt per radio, which we
apologised for and fixed in the next build, at the cost to a reporter of a few
extra sighs. It is worth closing the gap because that is the only way to catch
the next one, not because the last one was anyone's fault.

## Phase 1 — the listener's identity

**Done.** **SWL mode** now hides the transmit controls *and* swaps the
DX-cluster/POTA/SOTA spots and the awards for the listener's windows, a
**LISTEN window** with the
SWL reception log — station, frequency, UTC, mode, language, **SINPO or SIO**,
S-meter, notes — and a **REPORT** button that writes the entry as a reception
report to send to the broadcaster. The log lives in `swl_log.json`, its own
file, and records what was *heard* rather than worked.

The goal it was built for: opening the program should feel like a listener's
radio, not a transceiver with the transmit parts hidden.

**Done — the reception-report identity.** A listener's **SWL number** (Spots
tab, `net.json`'s `swl_id`) is the identity *receptions* are reported under:
it signs the PSK Reporter and WSPRnet uploads and the reception report the
LISTEN window copies out, and it is never keyed, never logged and never named
as a spotter. Empty, reporting falls back to the callsign, so a ham who spots
sees no change. A receive-only listener with an SWL number and a grid — and no
callsign at all — can report.

**Done — per-radio identity.** Each radio carries its own **callsign**
(Settings → Radio), falling back to the station callsign on the General tab:
the CB set keys and logs as its own while the HF rig keeps its amateur call.
The same radio stores its own **SWL mode** (`hide_tx`), so one radio can be a
listener's screen while another keeps its PTT, and in SWL mode the SPOTS window
keeps the receive-only networks (PSK Reporter, FreeDV Reporter, the broadcast
stations) and drops only the ham feeds (DX cluster, POTA, SOTA). Still open:
**CW reception reporting** to PSK Reporter — the network accepts it, the skimmer
does not upload yet.

- **Listener profile.** One setting that sets SWL mode and Simple UI, and hides
  the ham *receive* chrome that means nothing to a listener — awards
  (DXCC/WAS/WAZ), the DX-cluster/POTA/SOTA spots, QSL uploads — replacing them
  with station, schedule and propagation.
- **SWL listening log.** A log that records what was *heard*, not what was
  worked: station (from the schedule where known), frequency, UTC, mode,
  **SINPO/SIO**, language, programme notes, and an S-meter reading.
- **Reception report.** Generate a ready-to-send report for a station
  (station, date/time UTC, frequency, SINPO, receiver/antenna), the way SWLs
  report to broadcasters.

## Phase 2 — the broadcast schedule (the centrepiece)

**Almost done.** The **SCHEDULE window** browses the EiBi table: filter by a
chosen UTC time (or now), by metre band, language and target, and by free text
over name/site/country/language/target. A row can be **TUNE**d, or **LOG**ged
straight into the reception log with the station, language and site filled in.

**Complete.** Favourites are in: a row carries a star, starred stations are kept
by name in `broadcast_favourites.json`, and a **★ FAVS** filter shows only them
— tied to the station rather than to a bare frequency.

## Phase 3 — listening tools

- **Time-shift buffer / instant replay.** **Done** — a rolling two-minute window
  (mono, ~23 MB per receiver) and a **REPLAY** control in the LISTEN window: a
  DVR two minutes behind live. The CAT-audio path is not covered yet.
- **Scheduled recordings.** **Done** — a job is a start time, a frequency, a
  mode, a duration and what to capture (audio / I/Q / both); the RECORDINGS
  window lists and edits them, and a scheduler runs the engine's recorder. The
  filename is the engine's own for now; naming it after the station is a
  follow-up.
- **ECSS.** **Done** — two one-sided SAM presets, ECSS-U and ECSS-L, that keep
  one sideband and reject the other: the medium-wave DX trick for ducking an
  adjacent channel. Deliberately on SAM alone; AM and C-QUAM would not honour
  it.
- **Listener audio chain.** **Tone done** — a low-shelf / peak / high-shelf on
  the demodulated audio, in front of the speakers, edited in the LISTEN window.
  Noise reduction aimed at broadcast rather than speech is still open; the
  bandwidth side is the existing filter.
- **DAB / DAB+ (Digital Audio Broadcasting).** Wanted by a listener (upstream
  issue #483). **Built, then withdrawn from the shipped build (2026-10-01)** —
  see below for exactly what works and what does not, so it is not re-derived.
  The mode is off the band menu and `sdroxide_dab::DAB_ENABLED` is `false`; the
  code stays in the tree (`crates/sdroxide-dab`, the `Mode::Dab` lane) marked as
  not-shipped, to be finished rather than thrown away.

  **What works, proven off air** (10B at 211.648 MHz, an RSP1 at ~59 dB gain —
  40 dB was not enough to lock on a 50 cm whip): the OFDM front end syncs, the
  FIC decodes, and the **ensemble and service list** come up, including a
  multiplex that advertises no ensemble label (10B carries several — the list
  logic was fixed for that). The reference `dabradio` binary decodes all four of
  10B's services to audio.

  **What does not:** the DAB+ **audio** path. In our build faad2 refuses most
  Access Units with `FAAD_DECODE_ERROR` (bit errors) on **every** service — only
  a handful decode, so a station is silent or a fragment. Feeding the reference
  decoder's *own* known-good MSC frames through our superframe+faad2 reproduces
  it exactly, so the fault is **not** frame extraction, the OFDM chain, chunking
  or the AudioSpecificConfig (all verified identical to the reference): it is
  the **faad2 AAC step**, and it is content-dependent (`0x8009` limps with ~7
  good AUs, `0x8391` gets none). The reference takes the same AUs via fdk-aac.

  **The licence wall that decides any fix.** `dabradio`'s AAC stage is fdk-aac,
  optional there. The FDK licence grants **no patent licence** and forbids a
  copyright fee — the GPL cannot carry either, so **a binary with fdk-aac
  linked cannot be distributed** (why Debian ships it `non-free`). A fix must
  therefore be one of: (1) a GPL-compatible decoder that takes these AUs —
  **faad2 is the one we have and it is failing, so this is the open question**;
  (2) **fdk-aac loaded at run time**, not linked — the trick `vendor/dream`
  already uses for xHE-AAC, licence-clean and the proven escape; or (3) another
  GPL-compatible HE-AAC decoder (research). DAB (not DAB+) is MP2, pure Rust in
  `dabradio`, and is unaffected.

  **To bring it back:** fix the AAC step, flip `DAB_ENABLED` to `true`, and
  restore `Mode::Dab` to the two band-menu chip lists (`top_bar.rs`, OPERATE and
  LISTEN "Digital" rows). Nothing else is needed — the lane, the panel and the
  settings all still exist and are tested.

  The original scoping, for the record (the enabling find was **`dabradio`**,
  MIT, `xoolive/desperado`; the library split is draft PR
  [`xoolive/desperado#52`](https://github.com/xoolive/desperado/pull/52), which
  is what we build against — `fdk-aac` made optional there is what let us swap
  in faad2 at all):
  1. **It is a binary, not a library** (0.5.0) — answered: the author split it.
  2. **`fdk-aac` is a hard dependency** for DAB+ audio — swapped for faad2, which
     is where the current failure sits.
  3. **Application scaffolding stripped** — done: we use the DSP + FIC/MSC state
     machine, feeding our own I/Q.
  4. **Bandwidth.** DAB Mode I is **1.536 MHz** and wants ~2.048 Msps — a
     wideband lane like ADS-B's. Done: the lane centres on the ensemble.

  Off-air captures on hand, for re-testing without hardware: **12C** at a
  227.360 MHz centre, 2048 ksps raw `.cs16` (pvanderp, #483, 2026-09-22, via
  SDRconnect — it carries a ~40 kHz tune offset the decoder absorbs), and **8B**
  at 197.648 MHz, 2.5 Msps, ~30 s raw `.cs16` in a `.zst` (kevin2008-01, from a
  PlutoSDR; `xoolive` decoded it with `--service "BFM BUSINESS"`). The
  **dabradio 0.5.0 release binaries** replay either without a local build. The
  test capture used for the 2026-10-01 diagnosis was a 30 s 10B at 211.648 MHz
  from the bench RSP1.

**Eight more listening tools, audited from OpenHamClock 2026-09-22.** A
pass over [`accius/openhamclock`](https://github.com/accius/openhamclock)
(MIT) found that the two projects have largely converged — cluster/POTA/SOTA/
PSKReporter/RBN/WSPR/FreeDV spots, the broadcast table, the full space-weather
shelf (N0NBH band conditions, ionosonde MUF, Kp forecast, aurora, CME/flare
impact), SGP4 satellites, `cty.dat`, public-SDR directories and audible alerts
are all already ours. The remainder worth adapting, ranked for a listener and
noted for 11 m:

1. **Band-opening detector** (OpenHamClock `bandOpenings.js` — pure analysis:
   short 15-min vs 3-h baseline rates per band × continent-pair, ≥3× surge,
   ≥5 distinct calls, opening→active→closing hysteresis). Feed it the spot
   streams we already hold and a listener gets "20 m into VK just opened"; feed
   it our own FT8/WSJT-CB decodes and the CB skip-watcher gets "11 m into
   Southern Europe opening" **— relevant to both halves.** General-purpose:
   upstream-first. **PR #537 open upstream; the fork build (with the 11 m
   decode feed) is merged into local `main`** (2026-09-23). The upstream PR is
   the thing to land first; the fork's copy drops out once it does.
2. **Gray line on the flat maps.** **Done** (2026-09-23, `fork/gray-line`) —
   `sdroxide_solar::ephem::night_shade_rgba` off the same Sun the band
   conditions are read from, and a **NIGHT** chip on the FT8/FT4/FT2, WSPR and
   JS8 maps that paints night and twilight over the propagation heat and under
   the continents. The terminator still lives only in the 3D scene's shaders;
   the flat maps now agree with it.
3. **Meteor-shower calendar.** **Done** (2026-09-23, `fork/meteor-calendar`) —
   `sdroxide_solar::meteor`, the IMO table plus `radiant_altaz` from GMST in the
   same Earth-fixed frame as the subsolar point, listed at the foot of the
   BANDS window with peak ZHR and whether the radiant is up for the station.
4. **Space-weather trends + solar-cycle chart.** **Partly done** (2026-09-23,
   `fork/space-weather-trends`) — the AURORA panel now draws the planetary K
   **observed history** flowing into the forecast, which needed no new feed
   (`aurora::recent` halves the series the Kp product already carries). **Still
   open:** 24-h sparklines of solar wind / Bz / protons (a new SWPC product to
   fetch and parse) and the solar-cycle chart.
5. **Local time at the target.** **Done, as solar time** (2026-09-23,
   `fork/local-solar-time`) — `broadcast::local_solar_hhmm` and a **SOLAR TIME**
   chip on the SCHEDULE window, four minutes a degree from the site's longitude
   and labelled *solar*, not local: no DST, no zone borders. A true civil time
   zone needs a country-polygon dataset this fork will not carry for it.
6. **D-RAP absorption map** (SWPC's D-region grid, their `useDRAP.js` layer):
   why the low bands are dead at noon, and X-ray events. Lower 11 m value (a
   skip band), but daytime local absorption is real. **Not started.**
7. **IBP beacon checker.** **Done** (2026-09-23, `fork/ibp-beacons`) —
   `sdroxide_types::ibp` (18 beacons, 5 bands, the deterministic 180 s cycle)
   listed at the foot of the BANDS window with bearing and distance from the
   station, refreshed each second. The 10 m beacon at 28.200 MHz is the closest
   proxy for 11 m conditions; the same shape can later carry an 11 m beacon
   watch table.
8. **Azimuthal map** (their `azimuthalCRS.js`): a QTH-centred equidistant
   projection, with the bearing math we already have, for directional and
   portable listening — and it pairs with #1 to show which *azimuth* is
   opening. **Not started** — the flat map widget is equirectangular
   throughout, so this is a rework of it rather than a bolt-on.

**Signal-identification guide.** **Done** (2026-09-25) — the **SIG ID** window
in the LISTEN window ranks a built-in ~60-signal `sdroxide_types::signal_id`
catalogue against the dial's mode, frequency, band and passband, with a
free-text search and a **sigidwiki** link for the sample. The catalogue is ours;
the Artemis/Sigidwiki database is not licensed for redistribution (see AGENTS).
**Still open:** an **ACF** (envelope/spectrum autocorrelation) measurement from
the receive chain as a further identification feature — an "isolate it" DSP
change in its own PR, with no home until something feeds it.

### Decoder candidates for version 2

A survey (2026-09-23) of what this program does **not** decode yet, ranked for a
shortwave/CB/VHF listener and by how cleanly each fits the existing DSP chain.
The house rule holds: a new decoder is an "isolate it" upstream change, and
anything with a vocoder or a patent posture is called out.

**Done (2026-09-24): FSK441**, the original meteor-scatter mode and MSK144's
older sibling — 4-FSK at 441 baud on 882/1323/1764/2205 Hz, in a 30 s (and
15 s) T/R period, carrying the 43-character PUA-43 alphabet with
`R26`/`R27`/`RRR`/`73` as single-tone shorthand. Asked for on upstream **#542**
once MSK144 landed there as **#549**. **Not in mfsk-core**, unlike every mode in
item 1, so it is the fork's own decoder: `sdroxide-dsp`'s `fsk441.rs` — the
4-FSK matched-filter front end, the short underdense-trail ping search, the
sample-level sync search and the alphabet — ported from the MIT
[`Nythbran23/FSK441-PLUS`](https://github.com/Nythbran23/FSK441-PLUS) reference
(K1JT's own specification is at
<http://www.qsl.net/zs2pe/VHF/Digital/FSK441Def.htm>). It resamples the clean tap
to **11 025 Hz** (441 baud × 25 samples), the rate the constants are defined at,
rather than the 12 kHz the mfsk-core modes use. Receive only, with a
`Fsk441Period` setting (15/30 s) giving it FST4's and Q65's shape;
`PROTO_VERSION` 175 → 176. **Offered upstream as an "isolate it" PR, #555**
(branch `upstream-pr/fsk441`). Checked against the Sigidwiki *FSK441Burst*
off-air sample (a ping from YO2NAA) as well as synthetic pings; a live 6 m/2 m
ping is still the bench check.

**Next up:** the **DSC audio front end** (item 2 below) — the protocol and
framer are done, but the packet FSK detector does not acquire the DSC tone pair
cleanly, so it needs tuning against a captured ITU-R M.493 burst. After that,
**ALE / HF Selcall** (item 3) is the largest untouched utility-HF decoder.

1. **The mfsk-core modes we already link but do not build.** **Done
   (2026-09-23):** `sdroxide-digi` now enables **JT65, JT9, Q65 (ten
   sub-modes), FST4 (five), MSK144 and UVPacket (four sub-modes)** alongside
   `ft8, ft4, wspr`. The WSJT-X ports share the `DecodeRequest` shape the
   FT8/FT4 path already uses, so each was a decode request plus panel wiring;
   UVPacket is not a WSJT-X mode but a packet byte pipe, so it got a dedicated
   panel rather than the decode list. The CB callsign grammar hook
   (`also_accept`) is applied per mode. Still open from this item: the
   WSPR-adjacent upload path for FST4W and Q65 beacons (`SpotKind`), which
   none of the added modes uses yet.
2. **DSC** (Digital Selective Calling — marine distress and routine, VHF CH70
   and MF/HF 2187.5/4207.5/6312/8414.5 kHz). SOLAS selective calling: a
   1200-baud FFSK burst with BCH(10,7) error correction, carrying the MMSI of
   the caller and the called, the distress nature, and the follow-on working
   channel. Genuinely SWL — it is the one marine emergency channel a listener
   can decode — and self-contained. Reference: **GopherTrunk**
   (`internal/radio/dsc` + `ffsk`, Go, Apache-2.0) and
    `tomastnc/vhf-dsc-decoder` (Python, Unlicense). Low–moderate: a binary-FSK
    front end plus a small parser, portable to Rust. **Protocol + framer done**
    (`fork/dsc`, 2026-09-23): `sdroxide_types::dsc` has the BCH(10,7) codec,
    the MMSI/position codecs, the format/category/nature tables, the parser and
    the DX/RX `DscFramer`, all unit-tested at the bit level (encode → frame →
    parse round-trips a distress alert and an inverted individual call).
    **The audio front end is the open half:** `sdroxide_dsp::dsc::DscRx` wraps
    the packet FSK detector at a new `AfskProfile::Dsc` (1200 baud, 1300/2100
    Hz), but the packet detector's constants do not acquire cleanly on the DSC
    tone pair, so its two audio round-trip tests are `#[ignore]`d. Tuning
    against a captured ITU-R M.493 burst is the way in — see the bench note in
    `AGENTS.md` (the RSP1 on this machine captures fine, but no DSC burst was
    caught in the 2187.5/8414.5 kHz windows tried).
2b. **JTTY** (the WSJT-X 3.2 RTTY-like asynchronous text mode). Not a
   slotted mode: a transmission starts any time, each **1.888 s frame** carries
   a 32-bit source-grammar word + reserved-zero bit + EOM bit, a 12-bit CRC,
   and a **tail-biting K=10 rate-1/2 convolutional code** (TBCC), sent as
   4-GFSK at 31.25 baud, ~125 Hz wide, sandwiched around a 13-symbol sync
   sequence. Speed ~30 wpm arbitrary text, up to 60 wpm structured exchanges.
   Reference is `WSJTX/wsjtx` tag **`v3.2.0-rc1`**, `lib/jtty/` (Fortran,
   GPL-3.0-or-later — it is **not** in `mfsk-core` and not even on `master`).
   **Spike done (2026-09-28): the FEC is faithful and reproducible.** A Rust
   port of the encoder (`tbcc.f90` + the `1167/1545/0x80F` profile) matches the
   reference tone symbols **bit-for-bit** on six golden vectors (generated by
   compiling the reference with gfortran on this machine), and a circular
   Viterbi + CRC decoder corrects **5–6 of 46 symbol errors** cleanly — the
   reference's richer list/coherent-block decoder corrects 8, so parity is
   close and the simple form already exceeds a first cut's needs. Scratch
   harness: `/tmp/opencode/jtty-rs` (encoder + decoder, 5 tests) and
   `/tmp/opencode/jttyref` (compiled reference + vector emitters). Build
   staged as: **RX-only first** (DSP front end, FEC, source *decoder*, decode
   panel) then **TX** (DP min-frame packer, contest profiles, async keying),
   mirroring how FSK441 shipped receive before transmit. The 11 m port is
   wiring only — it is HF/VHF text over SSB, so it rides the existing lanes and
   `is_cb_callsign`, with the same `also_accept` union the FT8 path uses for CB
   calls. `PROTO_VERSION` bumps once per stage; `Mode::Jtty` appended.
   Reference layout: `jtty_mdecode.f90` (1228 lines, the receive detector +
   coherent block power), `tbcc.f90` (422, encode + WAVA + CRC),
   `jtty_tbcc_list_decoder.f90` (1168, the optimized list decoder),
   `jtty_mod.f90` (447, source grammar), `jtty_source_codec.f90` (STRUCT30
   atoms).

   **Done (2026-09-28), receive and transmit, merged to `main` — EXPERIMENTAL
   and fork-only, not offered upstream.** The
   DSP is `sdroxide-dsp/src/jtty.rs`: the TBCC code, the source grammar both
   ways (a circular Viterbi + CRC decoder, and the reference's DP text packer),
   the 4-GFSK synthesizer and the sync search. It checks against the reference
   at every layer — the encoder matches six golden tone vectors bit-for-bit, the
   decoder renders every representative source vector exactly, a packed message
   round-trips through the decoder, and a CQ packs to the spec's word bit for
   bit. `JttyController` is the asynchronous receiver and transmitter (`Mode::
   Jtty`, discriminant 52): a rolling window for receive and a one-shot burst
   for transmit, with an end-to-end test that keys, plays the burst, resamples
   both ways and reads the message back. The panel is a message log with a TX
   row. An 11 m CB identifier falls back to TEXT5 and reads back exactly.
   **Not tested off-air** — only synthetic frames; the WSJT-X sample WAV and a
   real over are the bench check. No calling frequency (the mode is too new to
   have one); `PROTO_VERSION` 179 → 180.
3. **ALE / HF Selcall** (MIL-STD-188-141 2G automatic link establishment, plus
   the 2G/3G sounding and a selective call). The utility-HF monitoring staple —
   who is calling whom, and on which channel. Asked for upstream as **#262**.
   Moderate–high: receive-only first (no ARQ), the way FSK441 and ACARS shipped.

   **Physical layer (pinned 2026-09-29).** 8-ary FSK, **tones 750–2500 Hz spaced
   250 Hz**, **125 baud** (8 ms/symbol), 3 bits/symbol, 375 bps; the 24-bit ALE
   word is `3-bit type + 21-bit payload` (three 7-bit ASCII characters), extended
   **Golay(24,12)** over the two 12-bit halves → 48 bits, bit-interleaved, one
   stuffing bit → 49, and each 49-bit word sent **three times** (majority vote).
   Word types: DATA / THRU / TO / TWS / FROM / TIS / CMD / REP; the ASCII-64 set
   is `A–Z 0–9 space @ ? . - /`. A message is a run of words (`TO`, `FROM`, …).

   **Reference-quality warning — do not port blind.** `Alex-Pennington/PC-ALE`
   (C++17, MIT) looks like a clean-room implementation but is **internally
   contradictory**: its `ale_types.h` puts the tones at 750–1625 Hz **125 Hz**
   apart (the standard is 750–2500 Hz at **250 Hz**), and its word parser's own
   comments say first "49 symbols = 147 bits", then "the 24 bits ARE the word, no
   Golay at word level" — the opposite of the spec. It cannot be trusted as the
   decode    authority; **MIL-STD-188-141B Appendix A is**, and a second
   independent decoder should confirm the interleaver and the symbol mapping
   before any of it is written here. The standard's PDF is not cheaply
   machine-readable, so the practical route to those two tables is a compact C
   decoder of the same waveform — **`dB-SPL/ALELite`** (FED-STD-1045A) or
   **LinuxALE** (MIL-STD-188-141A) — read only for the Golay(24,12) generator
   and the 48-bit interleaver, then reimplemented. **Exact items still open:**
   the Golay variant/bit order (PC-ALE's parity table does not match a plain
   systematic `0xAE3`/`0xC75` encode, so it is not the one), the 48-bit
   interleaver permutation, and whether the 3× redundancy is over the 49-bit
   codeword before or after symbol grouping. **Tried empirically (2026-09-29)
   and it did not converge:** brute-forcing timing offset × bit order ×
   Gray/direct × stuff position × three interleavers × two Golay generators ×
   word order over the sample produced only ~8 charset-valid words and **no
   repeated 3× preamble**, which a correct ALE decoder must show at every
   transmission start — so one of those assumptions is still wrong and the
   tables have to come from the reference, not a search. (The sample is also
   MP3, so its timing jitter hurts a blind search.)

   **Exact algorithm located (2026-09-29).** `dB-SPL/ALELite`'s
   `SourceALE/ALEDoc.cpp` (`RxFEC`/`DeGolay`/`decode`) and
   `SourceALE/ALEConstants.h` are the authority: standard systematic extended
   Golay(24,12) with `enc[4096]`/`e[4096]`/`wt[4096]` (`encode(x)=(x<<12)|enc[x]`,
   `enc[1]=0x5C7`), and a **bit-level ping-pong deinterleaver** over 49 symbols
   with the three copies at circular offsets 0 / 16–17 / 32–33, combined through
   `mtable[512]`/`utable[512]`. A Python mirror of `RxFEC` runs over the sample
   but does not yet converge (no preamble triple), so the remaining suspect is
   the **front end** — symbol timing and the tone→symbol mapping — not the FEC.
   **Done (2026-09-29): the FEC is proven.** `TxFEC` (from the same file) fed
   through the Python `RxFEC` mirror round-trips **six words exactly**, so the
   Golay + ping-pong interleaver is right. **Still open: the front end.** A
   naive per-symbol extraction of the MP3 sample (8 tone correlators, 64-sample
   windows) does **not** decode — and an earlier apparent `RAK/QEO/02R` run was
   a mistake (per-*sample* symbols fed by accident; the pattern was chance). So
   the real remaining work is an **8-FSK demodulator with symbol-timing
   recovery** (matched filter + clock tracking, as ALELite's own modem does),
   and a cleaner capture than a lossy MP3 to validate it. (ALELite is GPL; use
   its tables to validate only, and derive the Golay generator and interleaver
   for the shipped code.)

   **Core proven synthetically (2026-09-29).** ALE audio synthesized from the
   reference `TxFEC` (a known 24-bit word → 49 symbols → 8-FSK tones) runs
   through the Python demod (8 tone correlators, 64-sample windows, **identity**
   tone→symbol map) and `RxFEC`, and the exact word comes back **three times**.
   So the **demod, interleaver and Golay are all correct**; the tone→symbol map
   is the tone index directly, not Gray. The off-air MP3 still does not decode
   with this front end (no clock/AGC handling, lossy audio), so that sample
   stays a weaker check than the synthetic round-trip and a live capture. Next:
   **Rust core done (2026-09-29) — `sdroxide-dsp/src/ale.rs`,
   upstream draft PR #598.** Table-driven NTIA/ITS constants in
   `ale_tables.rs` (public domain, cited); four tests pass, including a full
   synthesized-tone → demod → FEC round-trip. **Still to do: the mode wiring
   (`Mode::Ale`, status, controller, panel) and symbol-clock recovery for real
   signals, then an off-air check.** The front end landed too (PR #598,
   2026-09-29): a per-burst symbol-clock search and repeat-filtered decode,
   with a synthetic test that carries a clock offset and noise. **The Sigidwiki
   MP3 sample still does not decode under any tone mapping or a +/-150 Hz tone
   offset**, while the synthetic path does — so either that recording is not
   plain 2G ALE, or it is too degraded, and **a live RSP1 capture on an ALE
   channel (HFGCS 8992/11175 kHz USB) is the real pass test.** Mode wiring
   still to do.

   **Validation material: found (2026-09-29).** The Sigidwiki 2G ALE page's
   `Signal file` (not an image, which is why the API's `images` list missed it)
   is **`https://www.sigidwiki.com/images/a/ab/2G_ALEaudio.mp3`** — 30 s of real
   ALE. Decoded to 8 kHz mono and FFT'd, its peaks sit exactly on the eight
   tones **750/1000/1250/1500/1750/2000/2250/2500 Hz**, confirming the physical
   layer above. Two caveats for the fixture: it is a **lossy MP3** (fine for a
   lock/tone check, less so for a bit-for-bit FEC assertion), and the page
   publishes **no ground-truth decode** (no `TO`/`FROM` text), so a first pass
   validates that the front end locks and the words come out coherent and
   plausible, not that they match a known pair. Better ground truth — an
   off-air capture with a known address pair, or a second decoder to cross-check
   — is still wanted before this is offered upstream. **Not started.**
4. **M17** (the open amateur digital-voice standard, 4-FSK 4800 sym/s + Codec2
   3200). Asked for upstream as **#449**, with a sensible v1 sketched there: LSF
   decode showing the other station's call, sync/SNR, own-call LSF on transmit,
   and packet/data mode as a stretch. No AMBE patent exposure, which is the
   whole draw. **Licence caution on the reference code:** the canonical
   implementations (`M17-Project/libm17`, `M17_Implementations`) are **C and
   GPL-2.0**, and GPL-2.0-*only* is incompatible with this GPL-3 program — so
   this is either a clean-room Rust port from the open spec or first confirm the
   `m17core`/`m17app` Rust crates this entry used to name are really MIT (that
   line was never re-checked). Codec2 is LGPL and sits behind a feature like the
   existing vocoders. **Scope: RX-only first** — the LSF and the packet/SMS data
   half are the cheap, dependency-free part; voice needs Codec2. Medium–high.
   **Not started.**
5. **POCSAG / FLEX** (VHF/UHF paging). Same FSK DSP as several modes already
   present; reference `multimon-ng` (GPL-2+) or an MIT POCSAG in
   `AXRoux/sigint-decoder`. Moderate. **Not started.**
6. **ARDOP** (HF ARQ for Winlink; the fork already ships a Winlink client, so
   this completes that workflow). `ardopcf` (MIT) or ProjectUltra's
   `ultra_tnc` (Rust, MIT). Med–high (ARQ timing). **Not started.**
7. **FLARM / OGN** (glider traffic, slots beside the existing ADS-B lane and
   map). **`rs1090`** (Rust, MIT). Low. **Not started.**
8. **UAT 978 MHz ADS-B** (the US 978 MHz sibling; the wideband-lane pattern
   already exists). `dump978-fa` (BSD-2). Moderate (RS FEC + a 2 Msps lane).
   **Not started.**
9. **Inmarsat** (the L-band maritime/aero satellite downlink — Aero, STD-C/EGC
   and the classic voice). Asked for upstream as **#187**. A listener's classic
   target, and the one item here that is a **wideband-lane** decoder rather than
   a 12 kHz audio mode: the L-band downlink is a different front end from HF, so
   it needs the ADS-B-style wide lane plus its own demodulators. The reachable
   targets are **STD-C/EGC** text and **Aero**; a SatDump-derived chain is the
   reference. Higher effort and a new research line. **Not costed, not
   started** — added at the operator's request (2026-09-29).

**Not recommended.** The **DMR/D-STAR/YSF/P25/NXDN/TETRA** family (GopherTrunk,
Apache-2.0, and DSD-FME, GPL-3) is high effort *and* its AMBE/AMBE+2 vocoder is
patent-encumbered — M17 above avoids both. **VARA** is proprietary with no open
codec; **PACTOR**'s only open attempt is AGPL, incompatible with this GPL-3
program. **MFSK16/Contestia/DominoEX/Throb** are close cousins of modes already
present and only complete in fldigi (GPL-3), so low urgency. L-band **Iridium**
needs a front end most listeners do not have (Inmarsat, the reachable L-band
target, is item 9).

## Phase 4 — polish

- **Say why the dial is not the frequency you picked.** Several modes tune
  *off* the dial on purpose — radiofax 1.9 kHz below a published carrier (USB),
  CW a sidetone-pitch up, RTTY its tone pair — and the dial is the only number
  an operator watches, so it reads as a fault when it disagrees with the chip
  they just clicked. #527 is the radiofax case ("GYA 4610 → dial 4608.1"); #497
  was the opposite (the dial never followed at all). **Partly done:** the WEFAX
  panel now pairs the two numbers in its header (`carrier 4610.0 · dial 4608.1
  kHz (USB −1.9k)`), which fixes the reported case. **Still open, and general:**
  a short offset annotation at the frequency readout itself, fed by each mode's
  existing `Mode::on_air_hz` / `tunes_off_dial`, so every mode gets it from one
  mechanism rather than a per-panel fix. The readout is a shared widget, so this
  is an **upstream** offer, not a fork one — the fork's per-panel note is a stop
  until upstream carries the general form.
- **UTC first**: **UTC clock** in the SCHEDULE and LISTEN windows, where a
  listener works. A general "UTC everywhere" pass is still open.
- **Utility labels**: **Done** — a built-in table (time signals WWV/WWVH, CHU,
  RWM, BPM; Shannon/RAF/New York VOLMET; the Buzzer), merged into every loaded
  schedule so they get the same labels and can be starred and logged.
- **Band naming**: **Done** — the band chip names the metre band on shortwave
  ("SW 49m · AM") and the band/mode menu offers the metre bands as shortcuts,
  from one table shared with the schedule's filter.
- **Band scanning for listeners**: **Done** — a Broadcast band row in the
  scanner (LW, MW and every metre band as one-click ranges), and the status
  line names the station it stops on.
- **DRM for the listener**: the programme label and scrolling text are already
  decoded and shown. The **MOT slideshow** is the part left: the vendored Dream
  decoder compiles the MOT and Journaline classes but the Rust shim only
  surfaces the label and text, so it needs the shim extended (C++ + FFI + a
  panel) and a real signal with a slideshow to validate. The largest remaining
  item.
- **HD Radio (NRSC-5) for the listener.** **Upstream's now.** The FM digital
  sidecar — a `Mode`, the vendored nrsc5 receiver, the panel with sync, MER,
  CBER, programme and station text — landed upstream with issue #437, and this
  fork's own copy was retired in the merge (it depends on `sdroxide-faad2`).
  Anything further here — the **AM-band variant**, the **HD-2/HD-3 subchannel**
  chips, the **album art / PSD** — is upstream's to take; offer it there first.
- **Own the 3D window at the shell, not at the radio tab.** A long-lived OS
  window (`Solar3d`) lives inside each per-radio `SdroxideApp`, its viewport id
  is salted per radio, and the shell draws only the visible tab — so a hidden
  tab's window is held open by `Solar3d::keep_alive`, capped to one owner
  (`solar3d_owner`), with geometry kept per screen (`UiSettings::solar3d_window`).
  It works, but the ownership is upside down: the thing that decides a window
  exists (the shell) is not the thing that owns it.
  The clean shape is a **shell-owned window manager** in `MultiApp`: stable
  viewport ids, an explicit `owner: radio_id` per window, emitted every frame
  regardless of which tab is focused, so nothing is destroyed on a tab switch and
  `keep_alive`, the owner cap and the salt save/restore in `drain_events` all go
  away. **Scope:** move the `Solar3d` handles from `SdroxideApp` into the shell,
  route the per-frame inputs (qth, prop, decodes, sat lock) from the owning
  radio to it, fix a split-view policy (one window per pane, capped), and
  re-point the Display chip, the settings tab and the remote/browser path — a few
  hundred lines across `multi.rs`, `solar3d/mod.rs`, `frame.rs` and `mod.rs`.
  **Cost:** `keep_alive` already renders every open 3D window — that is what
  makes a tiling compositor behave — and the cap bounds it to one, so the
  refactor does not change steady-state GPU cost; it removes the per-frame
  `show_viewport_deferred` call for hidden tabs and the fragile salt juggling.
  Not urgent: do it if the window set grows past one, or if a second simultaneous
  window is ever wanted.

## 11 m operating (CB)

Both still design-stage. The reverse-engineering behind them is in
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) under "The LOG11DX WSJT bridge".

- **Auto mode — FT8/FT4/FT2, any band this radio may transmit on, default
  off.** **v1 landed.** An unattended sequencer that answers a new station's CQ,
  or calls CQ when none is heard, and repeats. The policy is pure
  (`sdroxide_types::auto`: `pick_cq`, `auto_ready`, `auto_block_reason`) and the
  loop is `app::auto_mode`, driven from the frame update so a run does not
  depend on which pane or tab is on screen. Selection is UI-side because the
  log's novelty index lives there — the engine never holds the logbook; "new" is
  `LogIndex::novelty(..).new_call`, the callsign never worked. The transmit
  watchdog paces it: once it trips, wait one `tx_watchdog_min` span and resume.
  Arming needs an FT mode, a band the licence gate lets this radio key
  (amateur always, 11 m once opened; broadcast and general coverage never), and
  a non-zero watchdog; it forces Auto Seq on and is session-only (never
  persisted, so a restart cannot bring up a transmitting radio). Disarming — by
  the operator, by tuning to a band it may not key, by losing the watchdog, or
  by the inactivity stop — is a **kill switch**: it also sends STOP QSO and STOP
  TX rather than leaving the contact in hand to sequence on. The **inactivity
  stop is per radio** (`RadioConfig::auto_idle_stop_min`, Radio tab), default
  20 minutes, capped at 45 — auto mode is for a bathroom break, not for leaving
  a station to work a contest unattended. Follow-ups: consult LOG11DX's
  `check-dupe.php` with the token so "new" uses the authoritative 11 m log; a
  focused test for the watchdog-pause and inactivity timing.
- **DX explorer on the 11 m map.** A source chip beside PROP / ALL BANDS / ONE
  BAND that swaps the local decodes for the 11 m community's live map, gated on
  the LOG11DX token; with no token the map keeps the present PSK/cluster spots.
  Clicking a spot opens it on log11dx.com — the "benefits LOG11" part — and the
  chip is branded LOG11DX. **Blocked on the feed:** the bridge uses none, so the
  endpoint and fields have to come from the developer; whether a spot carries a
  location decides the design.

## Not goals

- **Transmitting.** SWL mode is the default; there is no push to make transmit
  first-class here. It stays available for anyone who wants it, behind the
  upstream lockouts.
- **Ham operating aids.** Awards, contesting and QSL chasing are upstream's and
  stay read-only-or-hidden.
- **The CB band.** The opposite: 11 m is half of what this fork is now — the
  channel plans, the WSJT-CB interop and reporting, LOG11DX. It is not a
  listener afterthought and is not going away.

## Relationship to upstream

This fork is `madmedicnl/sdroxide-brown`, a fork of `dividebysandwich/sdroxide`.
Upstream changes are merged in regularly (after each release, or monthly, to
keep the conflicts small), and a feature that is useful to *anyone* — not just
CB or SWL — is offered **upstream-first**: branch from `upstream/main`, open
the PR, then merge the result back here. Upstream is responsive and has already
taken most of this fork's general-purpose work — HD Radio, the CW straight key,
audible alerts, station profiles, AIS, the editor themes, the USB sound-card
backend, the 11 m band, EiBi labelling, decode export and browser import, the
step-row snap. What is left here is the listener and CB work.
