# Autonomy journal

The running record of work done without the operator at the screen. **Newest
first**, one entry per work item, written when the item ends — a session can be
closed without warning, so nothing is held back for a tidy write-up at the end.

The rules for working this way are under "Working on your own" in
[`../../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md). The queue is [`../../TODO.md`](../../TODO.md)
and the view is [`PROJECT-BOARD.md`](PROJECT-BOARD.md). This file is not a
narrative and not a changelog: it is the state of play, so the next session (or
the operator after a night away) can start from it in one read.

Each entry, in this order:

- **Summary** — three or four plain sentences for the operator: what changed for
  him, what he can look at, what is still not done, what comes next. No crate
  names, no file paths, no jargon.
- **Done** — the item, the commits, and the commands with their numbers.
- **Not done / blocked** — what stopped, and the single question or dependency.
- **Next** — the first step of the next item.

## 2026-10-24 — The standing order for working unattended

**Summary.** Nothing in the program changed. The notes the agent works from now
say to keep going on its own when the goal and the boundaries are clear, to write
what happens in this journal as it happens, and to keep the TODO list and the
project board current. When an item is finished you will get a short plain
summary without having to ask for it.

**Done.**
- `AGENTS.md`: new section "Working on your own — the standing order" (the four
  things that make a task clear, the list of things that stop an item, the
  journal, the TODO/board updates, and the completion summary), and the header
  now names this journal.
- `docs/internal/AUTONOMY-JOURNAL.md`: this file, with its format.
- `docs/internal/README.md`: added to the file table.
- Docs only — no crate, no wire, no build. Nothing to run; `cargo check` not
  needed for a markdown change.

**Not done / blocked.** Nothing.

**Next.** The live queue is unchanged: the mode work, STANAG 4285 first —
[`MODE-PHASE-4-PROMPT.md`](MODE-PHASE-4-PROMPT.md) and
[`MODE-PROGRESS.md`](MODE-PROGRESS.md).
