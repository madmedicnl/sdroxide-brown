//! An [`IqSource`] for a radio that has no control port at all — a handheld, a
//! walkie, a toy, a USB-dongle rig: everything is sound cards. Receive arrives
//! from one of the computer's input devices as already-demodulated audio (the
//! radio's headphone socket), transmit leaves as audio into one of its output
//! devices (the radio's mic socket), and the radio keys itself — there is no
//! PTT to command by definition, so it is the rig's VOX firing on the audio it
//! hears at that mic line.
//!
//! The shape is the audio half of [`crate::audio_cat_source::AudioCatSource`]
//! minus the serial: mono 48 kHz demod audio in, real TX audio out, a narrow
//! audio-band panadapter, and no dial to command anywhere — the centre is a
//! label the operator keeps in the app, because nothing else owns a knob.
