//! An [`IqSource`] for an Icom reached over its LAN or WiFi port.
//!
//! The radio is both the front end and the rig: control, audio and the
//! spectrum scope all arrive on one connection, so this source owns the whole
//! conversation the way [`crate::audio_cat_source::AudioCatSource`] owns a
//! serial port and a sound card.
//!
//! # Two receive paths
//!
//! No Icom offers I/Q over its network port — the IC-7760's RF deck has a USB
//! 3.0 socket that does, at 1.92 Msps, but it is reached through a
//! manufacturer-supplied FTDI D3XX driver and shares nothing with this
//! protocol. What the LAN gives instead is two different things, and the
//! operator picks between them:
//!
//! * **AF** — the radio demodulates and we get audio, exactly as with a CAT rig
//!   and a sound card. `caps.audio_mode` is set, and the *main* panadapter is
//!   the radio's own scope rather than an FFT of that audio: what the rig sends
//!   here is not a picture of the band, it is a picture of what already came
//!   through its filter, one-sided by construction and never wider than that
//!   filter. (The audio FFT comes back for the digital modes, which place
//!   stations by their offset inside the passband.)
//! * **12 kHz IF** — Icom's DRM output, a real IF in the audio stream. Mixed to
//!   baseband and decimated by two here, it becomes a 24 kHz complex stream the
//!   engine treats like any other front end, so sdroxide's own filters, noise
//!   reduction and decoders apply over roughly ±12 kHz.
//!
//! Either way the *wide* panadapter is fed from the radio's own `27 00` scope
//! sweep through [`IqSource::wide_spectrum_db`] — 475 finished bins covering up
//! to ±500 kHz. That is not I/Q and cannot be demodulated; it is a picture, and
//! it is the only wide view an Icom has. The span it sweeps is commanded from
//! here (`IcomNetConfig::scope_span`) rather than left at whatever the operator
//! last set on the radio's own screen, which is what made the strip come up
//! barely wider than the ±12 kHz IF beneath it.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! An IC-705 has received through this over WiFi, on the 12 kHz IF. An IC-7760
//! has connected over its RF deck's LAN port and streamed audio, its dial, its
//! meter and its scope (issue #183) — but that session ran *before* the model
//! was in the table, so what the trace proves is the transport, not the menu
//! writes or the 689-bin sweep now built from its CI-V reference guide. The one
//! thing that model has since been reported to do differently is its 12 kHz IF,
//! which arrives mirrored: see `sdroxide_icomnet::protocol::Model::if_inverted`
//! for what that costs and how little of it Icom documents.
//! Everything else — transmit, the other models' menu numbering, the meters —
//! is still only exercised against `sdroxide_icomnet::sim`, and the session
//! trace is copyable from the settings tab so a user with a radio can report
//! what actually happened.
