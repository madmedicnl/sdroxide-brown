//! `GET /aircraft-info/{icao}`: what the internet knows about one aircraft,
//! asked once for every client of the station.
//!
//! A client with the AIRCRAFT window open sends the address of the card it has
//! open, and optionally the callsign and registration the radio heard
//! (`?callsign=KLM1234&reg=PH-BXA`). It gets one JSON [`Info`] back: the
//! airframe, the route, and the address, page and credit of a photo. The picture
//! is `GET /aircraft-photo/{icao}`'s: a few thumbnails, in memory, for half a
//! minute or until the card is closed (see [`PhotoStore`]).
//!
//! The decision of what to answer is [`judge`], a function of plain values, so
//! the status codes are tested without a socket. The questions themselves are
//! the [`Relay`]'s: one out per key, a ceiling per minute, 24 h in the cache.
//!
//! Off unless the station's operator switched it on ([`enabled_by`]): it makes
//! this machine reach out to two services on behalf of whoever is connected,
//! and that is the operator's call, not a client's.
