//! or that nobody is worth answering and a CQ should go out instead. The UI
//! owns the log and the input clock, so the decision lives here beside them
//! while the actual sequencing stays in the engine's QSO machine.
//!
//! Auto mode is deliberately narrow. It is for the 11 m citizens' band only —

//! only ever answers a station calling CQ whose callsign is *new*: not one
//! already in the log. Calling a station mid-exchange, or working a dupe, is
