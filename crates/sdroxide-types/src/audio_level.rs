//! The level of the main receiver's audio, for the meters of a client that has

//!
//! A native screen could measure what it plays; a browser tab or a remote
//! screen is sent the audio late and in pieces, and a bar that moves to the
//! beat has to move with what the speakers are doing *now*. So the station
//! measures it where the sound is handed to the output and sends the result
//! about thirty times a second. Only the DAB status carried a level before.
