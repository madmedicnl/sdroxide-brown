//! (tr)uSDX CAT — DL2MAN/PE1NNZ's pocket QRP transceiver and the open uSDX
//! firmware it grew from. A fourth Kenwood dialect, with the audio *inside* the
//! control link.
//!
//! The radio emulates a Kenwood TS-480 and answers `ID;` with `020`, so on
//! paper a Kenwood profile would drive it. On the wire the subset is thin
//! enough that it would also spend most of its frames being refused: the
//! firmware answers `?;` to `SM`, `RM`, `SL`, `SH`, `PC`, `AG` (the bare read),
//! `FB`, `FR`, `FT`, `RA`, `SQ` and the rest, because it has no S-meter, no
//! SWR, no power control, no VFO B, no split and no keyer. What it *does*
//! answer is:
//!
//! | Command | Meaning |
//! |---------|---------|
//! | `FA;` / `FAnnnnnnnnnnn;` | read / set the dial |
//! | `MD;` / `MDn;` | read / set the mode, 1..5 = LSB USB CW FM AM |
//! | `IF;` | status: the dial, and the transmit flag |
//! | `ID;` | `ID020;` |
//! | `PS;` | power on/off state |
//! | `TX;` / `;TX0;` | key (the in-band nG sequence is `;TX0;`) |
//! | `RX;` | unkey |
//! | `AG0;` `FL0;` `RS;` `AI;` `VX;` `RC;` `RT1;` `XT1;` | the handful of |
//! |   | settings the firmware kept |
//!
//! Every one of those was confirmed against a bench radio rather than read off
//! the manual — see the module's own history. The manual's own list is a
//! *superset*: it names commands the firmware's parser does not reach.
//!
//! # The audio is on the same wire
//!
//! This is what makes it a family and not a Kenwood with a note attached. A
//! (tr)uSDX has **no sound card at all**. Receive audio and transmit audio are
//! 8-bit streams carried inside the CAT serial link, switched on with the
//! firmware's own `UA` extension:
//!
//! * `UA1;` turns streaming on with the speaker, `UA2;` with the speaker off,
//!   `UA0;` off. The reply is `UA1;` immediately followed by `US`.
//! * `US` is **not** terminated. Receive audio runs until a CAT command
//!   arrives, at which point the firmware writes a `;`, the reply, and then
//!   `US` again to resume. The host therefore sees
//!   `[audio] ; FA00014031000; US [audio]`, and has to tell the three apart.
//! * The receive rate is ~7812 samples/s (the firmware divides a timer; the
//!   measured figure on the bench was 7812.3, and the published ones — 7812,
//!   7820, 7825 — disagree). Transmit is 11520 samples/s, and the *host*
//!   paces it: the radio does not clock the bytes back.
//! * The firmware escapes a `0x3B` sample byte to `0x3C` on receive, because a
//!   bare `;` would end the stream. The host must do the same on transmit.
//!
//! # Two things about the hardware that the driver has to work around
//!
//! * **Opening the port may reset the radio.** On the common CH340 board the
//!   serial adapter's DTR is wired to the ATmega's reset, and the radio comes
//!   up announcing itself with an unsolicited `IF…;` a moment later. Toggling
//!   DTR resets it again. So DTR is held high for the whole session and never
//!   offered as a keying line — a PTT on DTR would reboot the radio on every
//!   over.
//! * **A CAT command written while the stream is running kills it** — on the
//!   **2.00x** generation. Not pauses it — kills it. Measured on the bench: a
//!   single `FA;` mid-stream took the rate from ~6 kB/s to zero, and re-sending
//!   `UA1;` over the dead stream made it worse. The stream only comes back when
//!   it is stopped (`UA0;`) and started again. So the 2.00x in-band mode polls
//!   nothing at all ([`TrUsdx::poll_requests`] is empty there), and every
//!   control frame is bracketed `UA0;` … `UA1;` by the serial thread. The
//!   radio's own dial and mode are therefore not followed, and each command
//!   costs a brief gap. **nG does not share this**: it takes a command
//!   mid-stream, pausing its own stream around the answer and resuming with
//!   `US`, so it is polled, its controls are followed, and its control frames
//!   go out bare (see [`TrUsdx::brackets_commands`]).
//!
//! Written against a bench radio running DL2MAN firmware 2.x, and against the
//! open uSDX firmware (`threeme3/usdx`) for the framing the two share. The
//! transmit-audio path is DL2MAN's and is not in the open firmware; its rate and
//! escape (and nG's whole sequence) are taken from his device specification and
//! from his own ARDOP client, and confirmed only as far as a dummy load allows.
//!
//! # nG, the second generation
//!
//! The same profile also drives DL2MAN's rewritten **nG** firmware
//! ([`TrUsdx::new_ng`], chosen by [`sdroxide_types::CatFamily::TrUsdxNg`]). The
//! receive side is the same — 7812.5 B/s, the same receive escape, the same
//! demultiplexer below — **except that nG half-rates the stream in CW with the
//! 1450 Hz ("1K4") filter**; [`Protocol::rx_audio_rate_hz`] reports that half
//! rate ([`TrUsdx::rx_rate`]) and the source resamples the stream back to the
//! nominal rate the engine is built for. Beyond that, nG differs from 2.00x in
//! **four** places, and each is a silent failure (or a visible one: distorted
//! audio, a waterfall that is only a sliver, a dial that will not follow) if
//! got wrong:
//!
//! * **It accepts a CAT command mid-stream.** A query pauses the stream, the
//!   reply follows, and `US` resumes it: `[audio] ; FAnnnnnnnnnnn; US [audio]`.
//!   So the dial poll runs — capped to about once a second, because each poll
//!   is a splice in the audio — and control frames are written **bare**, with
//!   no `UA0;`/`UA1;` bracket (see [`TrUsdx::brackets_commands`]).
//! * **The reply carries a trailing `;`** where 2.00x omits it: nG answers
//!   `FA…; US`, 2.00x answers `FA… US`. [`TrUsdx::parse`] takes either.
//! * The transmit **rate** is **4807.69 B/s** (the transmit slot is
//!   `20 MHz / (64 × 65)`), not 2.00x's 11520 — see
//!   [`sdroxide_types::TRUSDX_NG_TX_RATE_HZ`].
//! * The transmit **delimiter escape** is **`0x3B → 0x3A`**, both generations —
//!   see [`sdroxide_types::TRUSDX_TX_ESCAPE_TO`].
//!
//! The nG **transmit** sequence is the device specification's, and DL2MAN's own
//! client (`dl2man.de/ARDOP/client`, v0.4.34) is the reference for it:
//! `;TX0;` enters transmit — the leading `;` ends the running receive audio, or
//! the firmware reads `T`/`X`/`0` as samples — then a `US` frame carries the
//! 8-bit audio, opened by the first byte **≥ `0x80`** (a leading `0x80` is
//! emitted when the first real sample is low — see
//! [`sdroxide_types::TRUSDX_NG_TX_START_BYTE`]), and the bare `;` of
//! [`Protocol::tx_stream_close`] ends it before `RX;`. Without that closer the
//! firmware is still reading samples when the unkey arrives and swallows it.
//!
//! nG also adds a level extension the profile uses: `AG0nn;` (volume 00–31)
//! and `GTn;` (gain control 0 off / 1 on / 2 DIGI), neither answered nor
//! stored, so they are re-asserted whenever the link opens; and it accepts
//! `UA2;` to switch the radio's own speaker off while it streams.
//!
//! The CW half rate is a mode the profile cannot read a filter for, so it is
//! inferred: an nG rig in CW is assumed to be on the 1450 Hz filter and so to
//! be sending at the half rate. That is the safer of the two guesses — a
//! half-rate stream read as nominal plays an octave low, a full-rate one read
//! as half an octave high — and CW is where a listener watches the pitch. See
//! [`TrUsdx::rx_rate`].
//!
//! The nG figures come from DL2MAN's own notes for app developers and are
//! **not** confirmed against an nG radio here — the firmware was not available
//! on this bench. They are unit-tested structurally, and the on-air checks are
//! named in the fork's notes.
