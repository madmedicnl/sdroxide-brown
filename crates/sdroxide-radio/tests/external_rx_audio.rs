//! Receive audio that arrives from a *different* radio than the I/Q.
//!
//! The arrangement is a transceiver with another radio attached as its
//! panadapter, set to be listened to rather than demodulated here: the picture
//! comes from the attached receiver's I/Q and the sound from the transceiver's
//! own sound card. What that has to be true of, and what these hold:
//!
//! - the speaker plays the *transceiver's* audio, not what the engine
//!   demodulated from the receiver;
//! - the panadapter still spans the receiver's whole I/Q, so the operator gets
//!   the wideband display the pairing exists for;
//! - the S-meter reads the audio being heard rather than the chain measuring
//!   the other antenna;
//! - all of that holds with no audio output at all, where the engine has no
//!   main receive chain (#640).
