//! Who may move the antenna, and what happens when two things want to.
//!
//! The rotator has one motor and several would-be drivers: the satellite lock,
//! which recomputes geometry every 200 ms, and the operator, who points by hand.
//! Someone has to own it, and the distinction is what keeps a point the operator
//! made from being undone by the next tracking tick — a control that silently
//! does nothing, which this fork treats as a bug in its own right rather than a
//! layout detail.
//!
//! The daemon is a mock `rotctld` that records every `P` / `S` it is sent, so
//! the claim under test is what actually reached the wire.
//!
//! # One test, not two
//!
//! Both scenarios would set `SDROXIDE_CONFIG_DIR`, which is process-global, so
//! two tests in one binary race each other's engine. The second scenario uses
//! the directory the first left behind, which is fine — its point is that it
//! configures nothing.
