//! The panadapter's CTR must never park the hardware LO on the VFO.
//!
//! The report this comes from: an AM broadcast distorted "as if tuned 5 kHz
//! off" the moment CTR was clicked, cleared by any mode change, and clean
//! again once CTR was off. CTR keeps the window centred on the dial and asks
//! for that centre with `SetCenter`; taken literally it puts the LO exactly on
//! the VFO. A zero-IF front end has a DC spike there, and the carrier-centred
//! modes have passbands that contain DC — AM's is ±5 kHz — so the spike landed
//! in the demodulated channel and beat against the carrier. SSB and CW never
//! showed it because their passbands start a few hundred hertz up.
//!
//! `lo_guard_hz` already existed to keep the VFO away from the LO; the
//! `SetCenter` path was the one that went around it.
//!
//! FM HD Radio is the exception, and the last tests here hold it to that: its
//! digital sidebands sit well clear of the carrier, a DC spike on the carrier
//! was measured to cost it nothing, and a guard sized from its 744 kHz channel
//! left CTR 400 kHz short of the dial.
