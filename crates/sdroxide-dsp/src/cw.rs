//! CW (Morse): a receive decoder that tracks one tone and reads its keying, the
//! envelope-domain timing engine behind it, and a keyed-sidetone transmitter.
//!
//! The decoder is deliberately *not* the usual "measure each mark as it ends,
//! call it a dit or a dah against a running average, and adapt" design. That
//! shape has to commit to a decision threshold and to a speed before it has seen
//! the evidence, and on a weak or fading signal both guesses are wrong in the
//! same direction: a threshold set too high clips the marks short, which drags
//! the speed estimate up, which reclassifies the next dah as a dit. It is a
//! feedback loop with no way back, and it is why such decoders produce long runs
//! of `E`/`T`/`I` on exactly the signals you most want copied.
//!
//! [`CwDecoder`] instead keeps a few seconds of the keying envelope and, on each
//! hop, *searches* for the (threshold, dit length, edge bias) that make the run
//! lengths best fit Morse's own timing model — 1 and 3 units keyed, 1, 3 and 7
//! units of silence. The residual of that fit is a real confidence number: noise
//! has no timing model to fit, so its best cost stays high and nothing is
//! emitted. Only then are characters read off, and only the ones that have not
//! been emitted before. Nothing is decided before the evidence is in, and one
//! wrong element cannot poison what follows.
//!
//! The idea of scoring a candidate (speed, threshold) pair by how well the
//! resulting intervals fit Morse timing is Georgi Gerganov's, from ggmorse. What
//! is done differently here: the intervals are built once per threshold rather
//! than once per (speed, threshold) pair, the threshold rides a locally
//! estimated floor/peak pair so QSB cannot walk the signal out from under it,
//! the shaped-keying edge bias is a fitted parameter instead of an after-the-fact
//! rescale, character and word gaps are scored one-sided so Farnsworth spacing
//! is not read as a speed error, and emission is keyed to an absolute sample
//! index so a character is emitted exactly once.
//!
//! [`CwDecoder`] works on any envelope stream at any rate, so the wideband
//! skimmer's per-bin STFT envelopes go through the same engine as the panel's
//! narrowband audio path.
