//! Olivia MFSK modem: streaming decode + encode.
//!
//! Olivia is a strong, slow MFSK chat mode. A block of 64 MFSK symbols carries
//! `log2(tones)` characters: each character (7-bit ASCII) is spread across the
//! 64 symbols with a (64,7) biorthogonal Walsh/Hadamard code, one character per
//! MFSK bit-plane. The heavy coding gain is what makes Olivia decode well below
//! the noise floor. A fixed per-position tone scrambler spreads the spectrum and
//! (crucially) gives the receiver an unambiguous block boundary even during the
//! constant idle stream.
//!
//! Parameters are the tone count (2..=64) and the bandwidth in Hz; tone spacing =
//! bandwidth/tones and the symbol rate equals the spacing. Common combinations
//! are 32/1000, 16/500 and 8/250.
//!
//! **Interop status: receive works and is confirmed off the air, and transmit
//! now round-trips through our own receiver.** The last piece on receive was
//! the Walsh transform: our `fwht` used the textbook `(b1+b2, b1-b2)` butterfly,
//! where fldigi uses `(b2+b1, b2-b1)` (`pj_fht.h`). The two differ by a
//! per-row sign, and in Olivia a sign is *bit 6 of the character* — so every
//! lowercase letter (and the idle character) decoded as its bit-6-cleared twin
//! (`u` 117 → `5` 53, `h` 104 → `(` 40). The receiver now uses fldigi's `fht`,
//! and the Avalon SW Net recording (`CQ SouthWest NET … de G7LEE G7LEE G7LEE`)
//! decodes cleanly — see the `an_off_air_capture_decodes` test.
//!
//! The transmitter builds each codeword with `ifht`, the matching inverse, which
//! is what fldigi's `EncodeBlock` does; before that it used the textbook
//! convention, so our own transmission was not received by our own receiver.
//! Both loopbacks (`loopback_32_1000`, `loopback_8_250`) now pass.
//!
//! One convention difference from fldigi's source is deliberate and measured:
//! fldigi sets the symbol bit where its codeword is **negative** and hands its
//! own decoder a **negative** value for a set bit, while this receiver votes
//! **positive**. The two are exact negatives of each other, so they cannot both
//! describe the air; the recording decides, and it is the receiver that already
//! reads it correctly. `encode_block` says so where the bit is set.
//!
//! Everything else was already right: the 64-symbol block, the (64,7) Walsh
//! codeword per character, the Gray tone assignment, tone spacing = symbol rate,
//! and the `0xE257E6D0291574EC` scrambler with its 13-bit-per-character
//! rotation and the `(character + symbol) mod log2(tones)` interleave.
//!
//! **Start tones are now transmitted.** fldigi brackets every transmission with a
//! pair of tones at the band edges — see [`TONE_DURATION`] — and gates them on
//! `olivia_start_tones`, whose default is **true**, so a default fldigi
//! transmission carries them and matching it is the right thing to send.
//!
//! **They are not how fldigi acquires a frame, and an earlier note here said
//! they were.** `olivia_start_tones` is read only in `send_tones()`, which the
//! transmit path calls; the receiver never consults it and free-runs a
//! correlator bank over 17 frequency offsets by block phase
//! (`FreqOffsets = 2 * SyncMargin + 1`, `SyncIntegLen = 4`). Our receiver has
//! always free-run the same way, which is why every loopback passed without
//! them. Sending them is correct for interop fidelity; believing they are the
//! reason a decoder would copy nothing sent this note after a mechanism that
//! does not exist.
//!
//! Still absent, and not a regression: the **tail** (fldigi's stop tones plus a
//! short silence) and any **frequency search** beyond the caller's tone bank
//! centre. The tail cannot simply be appended inside [`OliviaTx`]: the caller
//! stops asking for audio the moment `sent_chars` reaches `total_chars`
//! (`text_modem.rs`), so tones generated into the block buffer would never be
//! drained. That needs a change to the transmit-active contract in the digi
//! engine, which is deliberately not smuggled in here.
