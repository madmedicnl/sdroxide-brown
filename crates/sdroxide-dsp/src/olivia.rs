//! Olivia MFSK modem: streaming decode + encode.
//!
//! Olivia is a strong, slow MFSK chat mode. A block of 64 MFSK symbols carries
//! `log2(tones)` characters: each character (7-bit ASCII) is spread across the
//! 64 symbols with a (64,7) biorthogonal Walsh/Hadamard code, one character per
//! MFSK bit-plane. The heavy coding gain is what makes Olivia decode well below
//! the noise floor. A fixed per-position tone scrambler spreads the spectrum and
//! (crucially) gives the receiver an unambiguous block boundary even during the
//! constant idle stream.
//!
//! Parameters are the tone count (2..=64) and the bandwidth in Hz; tone spacing =
//! bandwidth/tones and the symbol rate equals the spacing. Common combinations
//! are 32/1000, 16/500 and 8/250.
//!
//! **Interop status: receive works and is confirmed off the air, and transmit
//! now round-trips through our own receiver.** The last piece on receive was
//! the Walsh transform: our `fwht` used the textbook `(b1+b2, b1-b2)` butterfly,
//! where fldigi uses `(b2+b1, b2-b1)` (`pj_fht.h`). The two differ by a
//! per-row sign, and in Olivia a sign is *bit 6 of the character* — so every
//! lowercase letter (and the idle character) decoded as its bit-6-cleared twin
//! (`u` 117 → `5` 53, `h` 104 → `(` 40). The receiver now uses fldigi's `fht`,
//! and the Avalon SW Net recording (`CQ SouthWest NET … de G7LEE G7LEE G7LEE`)
//! decodes cleanly — see the `an_off_air_capture_decodes` test.
//!
//! The transmitter builds each codeword with `ifht`, the matching inverse, which
//! is what fldigi's `EncodeBlock` does; before that it used the textbook
//! convention, so our own transmission was not received by our own receiver.
//! Both loopbacks (`loopback_32_1000`, `loopback_8_250`) now pass.
//!
//! One convention difference from fldigi's source is deliberate and measured:
//! fldigi sets the symbol bit where its codeword is **negative** and hands its
//! own decoder a **negative** value for a set bit, while this receiver votes
//! **positive**. The two are exact negatives of each other, so they cannot both
//! describe the air; the recording decides, and it is the receiver that already
//! reads it correctly. `encode_block` says so where the bit is set.
//!
//! Everything else was already right: the 64-symbol block, the (64,7) Walsh
//! codeword per character, the Gray tone assignment, tone spacing = symbol rate,
//! and the `0xE257E6D0291574EC` scrambler with its 13-bit-per-character
//! rotation and the `(character + symbol) mod log2(tones)` interleave.
//!
//! Still absent, and not a regression: no explicit sync-tone/tail framing and no
//! frequency search beyond the caller's tone bank centre — real recordings have
//! decoded without them because the block-grid lock below finds the alignment.
