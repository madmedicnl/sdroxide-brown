//! Transmit-audio parametric EQ: three cascaded biquads (low shelf, mid peak,
//! high shelf) shaping the microphone signal ahead of the modulator.
//!
//! Coefficients follow the RBJ Audio EQ Cookbook, computed in `f64` and stored
//! as `f32`, the same precision split `DcBlock` uses. That's safe here because
//! these poles sit at ordinary audio corner frequencies (hundreds of Hz to a
//! few kHz over 48 kHz), nowhere near the unit circle the way a device-rate DC
//! blocker's is.
//!
//! Voice-only, hand-rolled: no biquad/filter-design crate exists anywhere in
//! this workspace, and this stays consistent with that (see `DcBlock` in
//! `demod.rs`).
