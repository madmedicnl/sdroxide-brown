//! STANAG 4285 Annex E — the coded rates: the convolutional code, the
//! interleaver and the message framing.
//!
//! Transcribed from Annex E of the standard (`docs/internal/STANAG4285-EDITION1.md`, "Annex E"),
//! and **none of it is cryptography**: a constraint-length-7 rate-1/2
//! convolutional code, a convolutional interleaver and a start/end-of-message
//! convention. The traffic's own encryption, where there is any, sits above this
//! layer and is neither described by the standard nor implemented here.
//!
//! The code is the ordinary NASA/CCSDS one — `G1 = 133`, `G2 = 171` octal, T1
//! first — and the lower rates are that code's output *pairs* repeated, never the
//! first bit repeated and then the second.
//!
//! ## What is certain, and what is not
//!
//! Every number below is read off the annex: the polynomials, the 32 rows, the
//! input commutator (`n·9 mod 32`), the 24-of-32 output commutator for 2400, the
//! SOM and EOM words, the flush counts and the decoder's structure.
//!
//! Two things the annex leaves open, and both are marked where they are used
//! because a reader has to know which way a wire was cut:
//!
//! * **which bit of each four is punctured** for the 2400 bps 8-PSK rate. The
//!   annex says "rate 1/2 punctured to rate 2/3" and nothing more, so that rate
//!   is not built here — a guess in a demapper is indistinguishable from a
//!   decode.
//! * **the character layer above the message.** Annex E carries a message
//!   protocol (SOM, EOM, flush) and calls what is between them "message bits";
//!   it does not say they are ITA2. A 75 bps link is exactly a 75 baud
//!   teleprinter, so ITA2 5N1.5 is what a test tape is expected to send, and
//!   both readings are offered rather than one assumed.
