//! STANAG 4285 — the receive side, uncoded rates.
//!
//! Transcribed from the standard itself (`docs/internal/STANAG4285-EDITION1.md`) rather than
//! from somebody's description of it, and **receive-only**: no modulator, and the
//! coded rates (Annex E) are not built.
//!
//! The frame, in full, because every one of these matters:
//!
//! * **256 symbols at 2400 baud** = 106.67 ms: **80 synchronisation** symbols,
//!   then 176 scrambled ones — three groups of `32 data + 16 reference`, then a
//!   final 32 data symbols with no reference after them.
//! * The synchronisation is **2PSK**, PN31 (two periods plus the first 18
//!   symbols), generator `x⁵ + x² + 1`, register set to `11010` at the start of
//!   every frame, **first symbol the LSB**, then 79 clocks.
//! * The 176 reference and data symbols are **scrambled** by `x⁹ + x⁴ + 1`, set
//!   to 1 each frame, **three bits per symbol**: `n = 4x₂ + 2x₁ + x₀` and
//!   `Bk = e^(jnπ/4)`, the register advancing three positions per symbol.
//! * The reference symbols are **all symbol 0 before scrambling**, which is the
//!   handle the whole receiver hangs on.
//!
//! ## Acquisition, and why it is a fold and not a peak
//!
//! The synchronisation sequence repeats every frame, so the correlation of the
//! received differential stream against the differentially encoded PN31 is a
//! **periodic** statistic: the right question is not "is there a peak here" but
//! "at which of the 256 symbol phases does this average over *many* frames stand
//! up". Measured on the night's captures: a single peak reaches 0.86 and so does
//! a strong PSK carrier of another mode (0.86 against 0.14 for the control when
//! the correlation is **folded over twelve frames**), while one frame's maximum
//! over every offset reaches 0.738 on white noise.
//!
//! Two more things have to be measured rather than assumed, and both were the
//! difference between 0.28 and 0.70 on the reference blocks:
//!
//! * **the sampling instant.** A receiver that resamples at a fixed phase lands
//!   anywhere inside the symbol. The fold is therefore searched over ten
//!   sub-symbol phases, and each frame refines its own timing again.
//! * **the carrier offset inside a block.** 16 symbols is 6.7 ms, so 150 Hz turns
//!   a whole circle inside one reference block and a perfectly good frame
//!   measures 0.3 instead of 0.9. It is corrected per block by a search, and the
//!   same correction is applied to the data.
//!
//! ## What this deliberately does not claim
//!
//! The three uncoded rates are 1200 BPSK, 2400 QPSK and 3600 8PSK, and **each of
//! those constellations is also used by coded rates** (1200 BPSK carries the
//! 75–600 bps rates at 1/16…1/2, QPSK carries 1200 at 1/2, 8PSK carries 2400 at
//! 2/3). A constellation test cannot tell them apart, so the rate is reported as
//! "uncoded, or a coded rate" and never as a claim. The coded payload needs
//! Annex E's FEC and interleaver, which are not transcribed, so the text of a
//! coded transmission is not readable here — and the payload bits are exposed so
//! that shows as bits rather than as silence.
