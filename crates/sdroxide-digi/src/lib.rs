//! Digital-mode engines for sdroxide: the slotted FT8/FT4 and JS8 modes, the
//! keyboard modems, and the image and voice modes.
//!
//! **Licensing:** this crate links `mfsk-core` (GPL-3.0-or-later) and carries
//! the JS8 protocol tables transcribed from JS8Call (also GPL-3.0-or-later).
//! It is the only crate in the workspace that does either, and it is used only
//! in the native binary — the wasm remote client links none of it (all
//! decode/encode runs server-side). Keep it that way: `sdroxide-types` and
//! `sdroxide-dsp` are deliberately free of both.
//!
//! The CW panel additionally links `sdroxide-deepcw`, which is AGPL-3.0-only.
//! That crate is the only AGPL in the tree; see its manifest for what §13 means
//! for anything that links it.
