//! The **document itself** is a wire type ([`sdroxide_types::Composer`]): each
//! transmit preset carries its own, so the console, a browser tab attached to
//! the same radio and the next session all compose the same picture. This module

//! little state machine that keeps one operator's edits from fighting the
//! engine's echo of them.
//!
//! Rendering is pure Rust (`ab_glyph` + `image`) so the native app and the wasm
//! browser client compose identically.
