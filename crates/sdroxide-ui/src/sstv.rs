//! SSTV image compositing for transmit: crop/scale a source picture to the

//! top of it, and overlay the slot's multi-line message (one bundled font, bold
//! with a black outline for readability, with the first line drawn at double
//! size).
//!
//! The banner is what the station puts its name on, so its two texts, its two
//! colours and its height come from [`sdroxide_types::DigiConfig`] rather than
//! from here — see [`Banner`]. The stock settings compose exactly the strip
//! this module used to hard-wire: the callsign at the left, `SDRoxide vX.Y.Z`
//! at the right, white on red fading to black.
//!
//! Pure-Rust (`image` + `ab_glyph`) so it runs identically in the native app and
//! the wasm browser client — the composed buffer is both the live preview and,
//! PNG-encoded, the transmit payload.
