/// spectrum, not five figures to subtract from each other — and in band order
/// rather than ranked, so that shape is the familiar one and the bars do not
/// swap places every time a decode lands.
///
/// What is measured is [`BandPlane::reach`]: the share of the world with

/// into one corner of Europe are one direction open, and a count would call
/// that the best band of the evening.
///
/// It inherits the propagation field's memory exactly, because it is read off
/// that field rather than accumulated beside it: whatever the half-life is set
/// to is how long a band stays on this chart after it shuts.
