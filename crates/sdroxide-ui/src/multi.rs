//! Multi-radio shell: one window, one radio per tab — or several side by
//! side.
//!
//! Each tab owns a complete [`SdroxideApp`] — controller, view state, panels,
//! decoders' UI — so radios are isolated by construction rather than by a
//! field-by-field split of the app struct. The shell draws the radio strip,
//! hands the rest of the window to the radios on screen, and gives every
//! hidden tab a chance to drain its engine's events each frame: a background
//! radio keeps decoding, logging, recording and reconnecting; it just isn't
//! drawn.
//!
//! The screen itself is a row of *panes* ([`MultiApp::panes`]). One pane is
//! the ordinary window; the strip's ⊞ toggles give further radios a pane of
//! their own, splitting the main area into equal columns that each carry
//! their own copy of the strip — so any pane can be switched to any radio
//! that isn't already on screen. Exactly one visible radio holds the
//! keyboard/MIDI focus; each [`SdroxideApp`] gates its input handling on it,
//! and clicking a pane moves it there.
//!
//! What keeps the radios from stepping on each other lives mostly *below*
//! the UI: each engine has its own config scope (`sdroxide_config::Store`),
//! the strip's mute chip is the engine's own per-receiver mute (the same
//! [`sdroxide_types::Command::SetMute`] state the MUTE button shows, so the
//! two always agree and the engine remembers it), a shared `TxGate` keys one
//! transmitter at a time, and a shared `StoreSync` keeps the station-wide
//! stores (memories, band stacks, digi config) converged across engines. Up
//! here the shell only has to salt the persisted view state per tab (and,
//! through `layout::set_radio_salt`, the fixed egui ids) and gate the
//! announcer and the window title to the focused one.
