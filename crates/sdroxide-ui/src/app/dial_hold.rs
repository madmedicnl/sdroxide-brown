//! The dial and the front-end centre this screen has just asked for, held
//! against the engine's snapshots that have not caught up with them yet.
//!
//! Every route that tunes from the screen — a key, the wheel, the readout's
//! digits, CTR's recentring — writes the new value into the local state at once
//! and sends the command. `RadioEvent::State` is the engine's whole snapshot,
//! and the one that arrives next is often its answer to an *earlier* command,
//! so adopting it as it stands puts the old dial and the old centre back for a
//! frame or two before the right ones land.
//!
//! With CTR lit that is visible: the panadapter recentres on the old dial, asks
//! the front end to move back, then forward again when the next snapshot comes
//! — the waterfall jumps, flickers and shakes for as long as the keys are
//! pressed, and settles the moment they stop. A tuning drag already keeps its
//! own dial against this (see `gesture-dial` in the panadapter); this is the
//! same protection for every other route, in the one place every command
//! leaves by.
//!
//! The engine still has the last word. A value it never echoes — a tune it
//! refused, a centre its downconverter clamped — is held only for
//! [`DIAL_HOLD_S`] from the first snapshot that disagreed, and then the
//! engine's value is taken.
