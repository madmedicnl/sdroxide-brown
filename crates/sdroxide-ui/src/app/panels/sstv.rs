//! The SSTV and RIFP image panel.
//!
//! [`SstvUi`] draws two things the engine owns and one it does not. The five
//! transmit presets and the gallery of received pictures live on the machine
//! the radio is plugged into — the panel holds metadata, thumbnails and
//! whatever pixels it has been handed, and asks for the rest. The picture
//! currently arriving is the exception: scanlines are painted into a texture as
//! they come, so a picture builds up on screen exactly as it does on the air.
//!
//! Compositing stays here. The crop, the header strip and the overlay text are
//! applied to the fetched source client-side, so the preview redraws on every
//! keystroke without a round trip, and only the finished picture goes back to
//! the engine as an ordinary `SstvTx` / `RifpTx`.
