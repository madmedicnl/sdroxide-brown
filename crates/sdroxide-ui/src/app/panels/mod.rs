//! - [`ais`] — the vessel list and the 162 MHz marine chart
//! - [`vdl2`] — the VDL Mode 2 message log and station list
//! - [`aprs`] — the APRS station list, map and messages
//! - [`cw`] — the Morse decode/keyboard panel, the one non-digital mode here
//! - [`decodes`] — the FT8/FT4/JS8 decode list and the QSO sequencer beside it
//! - [`text_modem`] — PSK, RTTY, Olivia, THOR, Contestia and Hellschreiber
//! - [`js8`], [`fsq`] — the two keyboard modes with their own message model
//! - [`sstv`], [`wefax`], [`rf_paint`] — the image modes
//! - [`wspr`] — the propagation beacon: receptions and the beacon's own cycle
//! - [`pi4`] — the PI4 propagation beacon: receptions and the one-minute cycle
//! - [`rade`] — FreeDV / RADE digital voice
//! - [`setup`] — the digimode setup window the panels share
