//! The grid tracker: the worked Maidenhead squares — or DXCC countries — on a map.
//!
//! The awards dashboard already tallies both grids and countries, and the 3D
//! view places entities on a globe, but neither says *where* a worked square is
//! on a flat map. This draws the log's 4-character squares as filled cells,
//! green where a QSL has come back and amber where it has not, so a gap in a
//! continent reads at a glance.
//!
//! A CB log carries no squares at all: an 11 m exchange is a country call and a
//! report, and the country is the leading digits of the callsign. So the map has
//! a **COUNTRY** mode as well, marking each worked DXCC entity at its nominal
//! centre — the same resolver the awards tally uses turns a CB call into its
//! country, so a CB operator and a ham see the same map in the form their band
//! uses. Which one it opens on is decided from the log.
//!
//! It is the listener's tool as much as a ham's, which is why the chip is not
//! hidden in SWL mode. A listener is not working anyone, so the live decode list
//! is offered as a second layer — heard rather than worked — behind a HEARD
//! toggle. The heard layer is drawn under the worked one so a square or country
//! that is both reads as worked.
