//! What the station's relay adds to an aircraft card, and how it is worded.
//!
//! The radio's data is the card; this is the optional extra. Everything here is
//! a decision on plain values — which question to ask, whether to ask it again,
//! how an answer reads, which badge a line wears — so it is tested without a
//! socket, a clock or a window. The asking itself is [`super::aircraft_online_io`].
//!
//! The rules it keeps:
//!
//! * the radio's lines come first and are never replaced by an online one; the
//!   online data only fills what the radio has not heard;
//! * a client asks its own station's `GET /aircraft-info/{icao}` and nothing
//!   else — no key, no account, no call to a registry or a photo service;
//! * a station that has the relay off, or none, is asked once and left alone;
//!   a failure is asked again no sooner than [`RETRY_S`] — and none of it is an
//!   error on the card;
//! * all of it lives in memory for the length of the session. Nothing is
//!   written to the browser or to the settings: the durable cache is the
//!   station's.
