//! The "PUBLIC SDRS" window: browse the receivers other people have published
//! and open one as a radio.
//!
//! Built on the same bones as [`crate::app::spots`], because it is the same
//! problem — a long list from the internet, filter chips, a fuzzy search, and a
//! row that does something when it is clicked.
//!
//! # Where the list comes from
//!
//! Not from here. The window asks
//! [`sdroxide_types::DeviceProbe::PublicSdrs`], which is answered by the
//! machine the radio is attached to — the same lane the device enumerations
//! use. That is what makes this work in a browser: the web client has no HTTP
//! client at all, and could not read either directory across origins if it had.
//! It is also the right end to ask, because it is the end that will hold the
//! connection: a receiver this screen can reach is no use if the station
//! cannot.
//!
//! # Being a guest
//!
//! A receiver that cannot be used is shown greyed with the reason rather than
//! hidden. Two of them matter and neither is obvious from outside: a KiwiSDR
//! whose operator has not opened any channels to non-browser apps will refuse
//! sdroxide however many are free, and a receiver whose channels are all in use
//! is somebody else's for the moment. Being told which is far better than a
//! connection that fails for no visible reason.
