//! The asking: one question to the station's relay, one thumbnail from
//! Planespotters' picture host, and the way back to the window.
//!
//! The decisions are [`super::aircraft_online`]'s; this only sends what it
//! says to send and hands back what arrives, over a channel the window drains
//! every frame. Native sends from a thread, the browser from a `fetch`.
//!
//! What goes out, and only this:
//!
//! * `GET {station}/aircraft-info/{icao}` — the station's own relay. The
//!   browser sends its cookie by itself; the native remote client signs in to
//!   the station with the password it already holds, once, and keeps the
//!   cookie it gets for the length of the run.
//! * `GET` of the thumbnail address the relay returned, unchanged, with no
//!   cookie and no referrer. It is the one request that goes anywhere but the
//!   station, and the one Planespotters' terms ask the client to make.
//!
//! The picture is decoded and drawn from memory and dropped with the window;
//! nothing is written to disk, to the browser's storage, or to the settings.
