//! Settings → Audio: your own sound, this radio's sound, and where recordings go.
//!
//! **One tab, because "audio" was spread over four of them under four different
//! names** — the operator's speakers and microphone on General, the rig's sound
//! card on Radio (differently again on each backend), speech on UI and the alert
//! tones on Alerts. None of those is wrong where it was; they are simply not
//! findable as one thing, and a beginner cannot tell which one owns a setting.
//!
//! The organising idea is **whose audio it is**, not which file it is saved in:
//!
//! - **Yours** is a property of this machine and the person at it. One screen,
//!   one operator, so it is station-wide and there is nothing to be per-radio
//!   about. Your microphone is here, which is the one an SSB operator asks for.
//! - **This radio's** is a property of the rig and what it is plugged into. The
//!   SS9900v on channel 26 and an SDR on the bench share this machine but not a
//!   sound card, so these stay with the radio — see [`RadioConfig`].
//!
//! A note on what a picker can and cannot promise: the device list is what the
//! host audio API enumerates, and a sound server may hold devices it does not
//! report. Every picker here is therefore also a text field ([`device_field`]),
//! because being unable to *name* a device is being unable to use it.
