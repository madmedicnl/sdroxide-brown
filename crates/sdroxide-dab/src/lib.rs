//! DAB / DAB+ reception for this program, wrapping the [`dabradio`] decoder.
//!
//! # Status: NOT SHIPPED — retained for future work
//!
//! **DAB is deliberately hidden from the user in this build.** Nothing in the UI
//! offers the mode, and [`DAB_ENABLED`] is `false`, which stops the engine
//! starting the lane even if a stored session still names `Mode::Dab`. The code
//! is kept so the work is not thrown away, not because it is ready.
//!
//! What it does do, proven off air: the OFDM front end syncs, the FIC decodes,
//! and the ensemble and **service list** come up — including a multiplex that
//! advertises no ensemble label, which some do. What it does **not** do: play a
//! station reliably. The DAB+ audio path decodes the first service of a capture
//! and then fails on others, and faad2 refuses most Access Units with
//! `FAAD_DECODE_ERROR` (bit errors) on **every** service — the reference
//! `dabradio` decoder (fdk-aac) takes the same Access Units cleanly. That is the
//! open problem, and it is a decoder problem, not a plumbing one: the frames
//! reaching the AAC step are byte-identical in size and Reed–Solomon-clean.
//!
//! ## The licence constraint that shapes any future fix
//!
//! `dabradio` reaches its AAC stage through **fdk-aac**, which is optional
//! there. The FDK licence grants **no patent licence** and forbids a copyright
//! licence fee — restrictions the GPL cannot carry — so a binary with fdk-aac
//! **linked in cannot be distributed** (it is why Debian ships it `non-free`).
//! This crate therefore runs the pipeline with fdk-aac **off** and hands the
//! Reed–Solomon-corrected Access Units to the **stock faad2** the binary already
//! carries for DRM ([`AacDecoder`]). Any future fix must stay on this side of
//! the line: a GPL-compatible decoder, or fdk-aac loaded **at run time** (the
//! trick `vendor/dream` already uses) rather than linked. DAB (not DAB+) carries
//! MP2, which is pure Rust in `dabradio` and needs no swap.
//!
//! DAB Mode I is a **wideband** service — about 1.536 MHz of occupied spectrum
//! in Band III, demodulated by an OFDM front end that wants its input at
//! 2.048 Msps — so, like ADS-B, it cannot ride the 12 kHz `on_rx_iq` tap the
//! narrow modes share. It is fed raw I/Q from a lane of its own.
