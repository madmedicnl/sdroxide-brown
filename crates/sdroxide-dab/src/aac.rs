//! Plain HE-AAC decode for DAB+, over the stock faad2 the binary already links.
//!
//! This is the counterpart of `dabradio`'s fdk-aac `AacDecoder`: the same three
//! calls (`new`, `configure`, `decode_au`) over the same DAB+ Access Units, but
//! through faad2 instead. `dabradio`'s optional-fdk-aac split exists so a caller
//! can do exactly this — its `SuperframeDecoder` (Fire code, Reed–Solomon,
//! Access Unit extraction) is always built, and only the AAC step is swapped.
//!
//! The C shim in `aac_shim.c` is deliberately the only `unsafe` in the crate:
//! the FFI lives there and this wrapper presents a safe surface.
