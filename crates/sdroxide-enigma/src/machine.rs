//! The machine: rotors, reflector, plugboard, and the stepping gear.
//!
//! This is the real Enigma I (three rotors) and the M4 (four rotors, with the
//! thin Beta/Gamma wheels), including the two facts that make it *itself* and
//! not a generic substitution cipher:
//!
//! - **A letter never enciphers to itself.** The reflector sends the signal
//!   back through the rotors, so no key on the board can ever light itself.
//!   That is a weakness of the machine, and it is kept here on purpose: it is
//!   what lets [`crate::solve`] prune the search, and it is what a reader of
//!   real Enigma traffic exploits.
//! - **The double-step.** The middle wheel advances on the right wheel's
//!   notch, and again when its own notch is reached, which makes the middle
//!   rotor step twice in a row. Getting this wrong is the classic "almost
//!   works" Enigma bug.
//!
//! Wiring is the historical data (the letter each contact is wired to on the
//! left, `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ` on the right), the notches, and the
//! reflectors. Every rotor is stored as a 26-byte forward permutation; the
//! reverse is derived once at construction.

/// One rotor: its forward wiring, the position(s) at which it steps its
/// neighbour, and — for the M4 — whether it is a thin (Greek) wheel.
