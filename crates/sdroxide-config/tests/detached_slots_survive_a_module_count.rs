//! A `detached` list that is the wrong length must cost that field, not the
//! whole `config.toml`.
//!
//! `UiSettings::detached` is one slot per [`DetachableModule`], so **adding a
//! module makes the array longer** — AUX SP is exactly that. Every config written
//! before it carries a shorter list, and the cost of getting this wrong is not a
//! lost window position: `Settings::load` *quarantines* a file it cannot parse
//! and answers `Settings::default()`, which would take the operator's theme,
//! fonts, layout and the rest of their station with it.
//!
//! One test in the binary, because `SDROXIDE_CONFIG_DIR` is process-global and
//! setting it from a `#[test]` sharing a binary with others would race them.
